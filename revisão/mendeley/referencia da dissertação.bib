abstract = {The end users' satisfactory Quality of Experience (QoE) is a fundamental criterion for networked video service providers such as video-on-demand providers (Netflix, YouTube, etc.), cloud gaming providers (Google Stadia, PlayStation Now, etc.) and videoconferencing providers (Zoom, Microsoft Teams, etc.). To know the QoE, providers today typically predict it from the Quality of Service (QoS) parameters or the client-side's actual QoE metrics measured at the current time-step. But the former does not precisely reflect the users' experience, and the latter has a delay between QoE measurements at the client-side and the user's current experience. Mitigating this delay can provide a noticeable improvement in the delivery system's performance. For example, accurate forecasting of QoE for the near future allows the service management system to take a proactive approach and fix delivery issues before they become a noticeable problem at the end user, or at least reduce overall QoE degradation. QoE forecasting can also be used in rate adaptation in DASH or resource allocation in wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a method to prognosticate QoE metrics. Using data collected from an industry video streaming testbed for three different classes, we define a multivariate time series forecasting problem. We then model a hybrid state-of-the-art deep learning method, BiLSTM-CNN, to forecast the QoE metrics in advance. Evaluation of our proposed method compared to four other well-known ML models of Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Long short-term memory (LSTM), and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) demonstrates the superior performance of our proposed method. {\textcopyright} 2020 IEEE.},

abstract = {Various time series forecasting methods have been successfully applied for the water-stage forecasting problem. Graphical time series models are a class of multivariate time series to model the spatio-temporal dependencies between the sensors. Constructing graph-based models involve data pre-processing and correlation analysis to capture the dynamics of different water flow scenarios, which is not scalable for a large network of sensors. This paper presents a novel approach to model spatio-temporal dependencies across river network stations using a partial correlation graph. We also provide a method to enrich this partial correlation graph by eliminating the spurious correlations. We demonstrate the utility of enriched partial correlation graphs in multivariate forecasting for various scenarios and state-of-the-art multivariate forecasting models. We observe that the forecasting techniques that use information from the enriched partial correlation graph outperform standard time series forecasting approaches for river network forecasting. {\textcopyright} 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract = {Goal: The United States (US) is currently one of the countries hardest-hit by the novel SARS-CoV-19 virus. One key difficulty in managing the outbreak at the national level is that due to the US' diversity, geographic spread, and economic inequality, the COVID-19 pandemic in the US acts more as a series of diverse regional outbreaks rather than a synchronized homogeneous one. Method: In order to determine how to assess regional risk related to COVID-19, a two-phase modeling approach is developed while considering demographic and economic criteria. First, an unsupervised clustering technique, specifically k-means, is employed to group US counties based on demographic and economic similarities. Then, time series forecasting of each cluster of counties is developed to assess the short-run viral transmissibility risk. Results: To this end, we test ARIMA and Seasonal Trend Random Walk forecasts to determine which is more appropriate for modeling the spread and lethality of COVID-19. From our analysis, we then utilize the superior ARIMA models to forecast future COVID-19 trends in the clusters, and present the areas in the US which have the highest COVID-19 related risk heading into the winter of 2020. Conclusion: Including sub-national socioeconomic characteristics to data-driven COVID-19 infection and fatality forecasts may play a key role in assessing the risk associated with changes in infection patterns at the national level. {\textcopyright} 2020 IEEE.},

abstract = {Despite the superiority of convolutional neural networks demonstrated in time series modeling and forecasting, it has not been fully explored on the design of the neural network architecture and the tuning of the hyper-parameters. Inspired by the incremental construction strategy for building a random multilayer perceptron, we propose a novel Error-feedback Stochastic Modeling (ESM) strategy to construct a random Convolutional Neural Network (ESM-CNN) for time series forecasting task, which builds the network architecture adaptively. The ESM strategy suggests that random filters and neurons of the error-feedback fully connected layer are incrementally added to steadily compensate the prediction error during the construction process, and then a filter selection strategy is introduced to enable ESM-CNN to extract the different size of temporal features, providing helpful information at each iterative process for the prediction. The performance of ESM-CNN is justified on its prediction accuracy of one-step-ahead and multi-step-ahead forecasting tasks respectively. Comprehensive experiments on both the synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed ESM-CNN not only outperforms the state-of-art random neural networks, but also exhibits stronger predictive power and less computing overhead in comparison to trained state-of-art deep neural network models. {\textcopyright} 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The current study aims to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on road traffic collisions, fatalities, and injuries using time series analyses. To that aim, a database containing road collisions, fatalities, and slight injuries data from Greece were derived from the Hellenic Statistical Authority (HSA) and covered a ten-year timeframe (from January 2010 to August 2020. The chosen time period contained normal operations, as well as the period of the first COVID-19-induced lockdown period in Greece. Three different Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) time series models were implemented in order to compare the observed measurements to forecasted values that were intended to depict assumed conditions; namely, without the appearance of the COVID-19 pandemic. Modelling results revealed that the total number of road collisions, fatalities, and slightly injured were decreased, mainly due to the sharp traffic volume decrease. However, the percentage reduction of the collision variables and traffic volume were found to be disproportionate, which probably indicates that more collisions occurred with regard to the prevailing traffic volume. An additional finding is that fatalities and slightly injured rates were significantly increased during the lockdown period and the subsequent month. Overall, it can be concluded that a worse performance was identified in terms of road safety. Since subsequent waves of COVID-19 cases and other pandemics may reappear in the future, the outcomes of the current study may be exploited for the improvement of road safety from local authorities and policymakers. {\textcopyright} 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Abstract: For analysis tasks, time counts are of interest – values recorded at some, usually equidistant, points in time. The calculation can be performed at various intervals: after a minute, an hour, a day, a week, a month, or a year, depending on how much detail the process should be analyzed. In time series analysis problems, we deal with discrete-time, when each observation of a parameter forms a time frame. The same can be said about the behavior of Covid-19 over time. In this paper, we solve the problem of predicting Covid-19 diseases in the world using neural networks. This approach is useful when it is necessary to overcome difficulties related to non-stationarity, incompleteness, unknown distribution of data, or when statistical methods are not completely satisfactory. The problem of forecasting is solved with the help of the analytical platform Deductor Studio, developed by specialists of the company Intersoft Lab of the Russian Federation. When solving this problem, appropriate methods were used to clean the data from noise and anomalies, which ensured the quality of building a predictive model and obtaining forecast values for tens of days ahead. The principle of time series forecasting was also demonstrated: import, seasonal detection, cleaning, smoothing, building a predictive model, and predicting Covid-19 diseases in the world using neural technologies for 30 days ahead. {\textcopyright} 2021, Allerton Press, Inc.},

abstract = {Forecasting future sea levels is of great importance in terms of the conservation of coastal areas, monitoring and forecasting coastal ecosystems, and the maintenance and planning of coastal structures. In addition, highly accurate sea level forecasts allow adequate water management policies and coastal infrastructures to be developed. Today, many methods, such as harmonic analyses, artificial neural networks and support vector machines, are used to predict sea level anomalies. In this study, a novel approach based on Copula functions is presented for the prediction of sea level anomalies. The primary purpose of this study is to examine the applicability and capability of Copula-based prediction models in predicting short-term variations in the sea level. The minimum 95% correlations and minimum 22 mm RMSE values in sea level anomaly predictions during the testing period indicate that the Copula approach can be a powerful tool in the prediction of sea level anomalies. {\textcopyright} 2020 Survey Review Ltd.},

abstract = {Non-stochastic hesitation in fuzzy time series forecasting methods occurs due to availability of more than one fuzzification methods of time series data. Recently hesitant fuzzy set has gained attention of the researchers to address issue of aforesaid non-stochastic hesitation. In this research paper, we propose and develop a computational algorithm-based method for financial time series forecasting using hesitant fuzzy set. The proposed method uses hesitant fuzzy logical relations that are constructed using triangular fuzzy sets with equal and unequal intervals. In the proposed forecasting method, hesitant fuzzy logical relations are aggregated using a hesitant fuzzy aggregation operator. Advantages of developed hesitant fuzzy set based forecasting method are that it is easy to implement, can cope with huge time series database and enhances the accuracy in financial time series forecast. To see the performance of proposed method in financial time series forecasting, it is implemented on two financial experimental dataset of TAIFEX and SBI share price at BSE. Rigorous comparison analysis of the proposed forecasting method is done by comparing it with other conventional and computational fuzzy time series forecasting methods in terms of RMSE, AFER. Significance of accuracy enhancement in forecasted outputs is also verified using two-tailed t test. {\textcopyright} 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract = {Multivariate time series forecasting has typically been a relevant and interesting topic in many fields, including economics, electricity consumption, solar energy, and traffic management. In these domains, owing to the complex dependencies among multiple variables and the mixed dependencies in the time dimension, it is challenging to forecast a multivariate time series precisely. Furthermore, most of the forecasting methods fail to capture the mixed influence of the different time-length dependencies among multiple variables. In this paper, a new deep learning framework is proposed for dealing with this challenging problem, named as mixed dependence time-series network (MDTNet). In this framework, stacked dilated convolutions and recurrent units are applied to extract the complex patterns in the long- and short-term mixed dependencies among multiple variables. The experiments show that our proposed framework yields significant results, outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline methods on three of the four benchmark datasets in large horizons and achieving a competitive performance in short horizons on all the benchmark datasets. {\textcopyright} 2021},

abstract = {Most time series forecasting tasks using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) relegate trend-cycle modeling to a simple preprocessing step. In this work, we propose an automatic feature engineering framework for modeling the trend-cycle (tofee-tree) in time series forecasting. The first stage of the framework automatically creates over 286 deterministic linear and nonlinear engineered features to model the trend-cycle. These features are based only on the time of observation and length of the time series, making them domain-agnostic. In the second stage of the framework, a SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)—based feature selection procedure using Light Gradient Boosted Machine (LightGBM) selects the most relevant features. These relevant features can be used for forecasting with ANNs in addition to the auto-regressive lags. Two popular ANNs—Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Long Short Term Memory network (LSTM) are used to evaluate our proposed tofee-tree framework. Comparisons against two empirical studies using the M3 competition dataset show that the proposed framework improved the overall Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE) in the one-step, medium- and long-term. The relative improvement in one-step SMAPE is 3% for MLP and 23% for LSTM. We also show that the residual seasonality left after deseasonalization can be modeled using the tofee-tree framework. {\textcopyright} 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract = {A fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) is a graph-based knowledge representation model wherein the connections of the nodes (edges) represent casual relationships between the knowledge items associated with the nodes. This model has been applied to solve various modeling tasks including forecasting time series. In the original FCM-based forecasting model, causal relationships among concepts of the FCM remain unchanged. However, causal relationships may change in time. Therefore, we propose a new learning method for training an FCM resulting in an adaptive FCM which consists of several sub-FCMs. It can select different sub-FCMs at different moments. In an active processing scenario, in which we deal with a large-scale time series with new data being continuously generated, a forecasting model built on the old data should be updated when the new data arrive. Furthermore, retraining an FCM from scratch entails increasing computing overhead that will become a serious obstacle in many practical scenarios. To overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings, this study offers an original design setting in which the FCM is updated by knowledge-guidance learning mechanism for the first time. Compared with the existing classical forecasting models, the proposed model shows higher accuracy and efficiency. Its increased performance is demonstrated through a series of reported experimental studies. IEEE},

This article proposes a new variant of SNP systems, called gated spiking neural P (GSNP) systems, which are composed of gated neurons. Two gated mechanisms are introduced in the nonlinear spiking mechanism of GSNP systems, consisting of a reset gate and a consumption gate. The two gates are used to control the updating of states in neurons. Based on gated neurons, a prediction model for time series is developed, known as the GSNP model. Several benchmark univariate and multivariate time series are used to evaluate the proposed GSNP model and to compare several state-of-the-art prediction models. The comparison results demonstrate the availability and effectiveness of GSNP for time series forecasting. IEEE},

abstract = {To address the challenges of big data analytics, several works have focused on big data optimization using metaheuristics. The constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is a fundamental concept of metaheuristics that has shown great efficiency in several fields. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are powerful machine learning algorithms that are applied especially frequently in time series analysis. However, one issue in forecasting time series using HMMs is how to reduce the search space (state and observation space). To address this issue, we propose a graph-based big data optimization approach using a CSP to enhance the results of learning and prediction tasks of HMMs. This approach takes full advantage of both HMMs, with the richness of their algorithms, and CSPs, with their many powerful and efficient solver algorithms. To verify the validity of the model, the proposed approach is evaluated on real-world data using the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and other metrics as measures of the prediction accuracy. The conducted experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the conventional model. It reduces the MAPE by 0.71% and offers a particularly good trade-off between computational costs and the quality of results for large datasets. It is also competitive with benchmark models in terms of the running time and prediction accuracy. Further comparisons substantiate these experimental findings. {\textcopyright} 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract = {Ensemble Model is a tool that has attracted attention due to its capability to improve the outcome performance of emerging techniques to solve the modelling and classifying problem. However, the feasibility of applying intelligent algorithms to build the Ensemble Model presents a challenge of its own. In this work, an Extreme Learning Machine ensemble is applied to the Time Series modelling problem. We develop a thorough study of the models that will be candidates to compose the ensemble, obtaining statistical results of optimal topologies to solve each Time Series problem. The proposed method for the ensemble is the weighted averaging method, where the parameters (weights) are tuned with the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. Lastly, the ensemble is tested first in the well known Santa Fe Time Series Competition benchmark. Given the obtained satisfactory results, the ensemble is secondly tested in a real problem of Spain's electric consumption forecasting. It is demonstrated that the PSO is a suitable algorithm to optimize Extreme Learning Machine ensemble and that the proposed strategy can obtain good results in both Time Series problems. {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Dissolved oxygen (DO) is an important indicator of aquaculture, and its accurate forecasting can effectively improve the quality of aquatic products. In this paper, a new DO hybrid forecasting model is proposed that includes three stages: multi-factor analysis, adaptive decomposition, and an optimization-based ensemble. First, considering the complex factors affecting DO, the grey relational (GR) degree method is used to screen out the environmental factors most closely related to DO. The consideration of multiple factors makes model fusion more effective. Second, the series of DO, water temperature, salinity, and oxygen saturation are decomposed adaptively into sub-series by means of the empirical wavelet transform (EWT) method. Then, five benchmark models are utilized to forecast the sub-series of EWT decomposition. The ensemble weights of these five sub-forecasting models are calculated by particle swarm optimization and gravitational search algorithm (PSOGSA). Finally, a multi-factor ensemble model for DO is obtained by weighted allocation. The performance of the proposed model is verified by time-series data collected by the pacific islands ocean observing system (PacIOOS) from the WQB04 station at Hilo. The evaluation indicators involved in the experiment include the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE), mean absolute percent error (MAPE), standard deviation of error (SDE), and coefficient of determination (R2). Example analysis demonstrates that: ① The proposed model can obtain excellent DO forecasting results; ② the proposed model is superior to other comparison models; and ③ the forecasting model can be used to analyze the trend of DO and enable managers to make better management decisions. {\textcopyright} 2021 THE AUTHORS},

abstract = {Purpose: The time series analysis is an essential methodology which comprises the tools for analyzing the time series data to identify the meaningful characteristics for making future ad-judgments. The purpose of this paper is to propose a Taylor series approximation and unbiased GM(1,1) based new hybrid statistical approach (HTS_UGM(1,1)) for forecasting time series data under the poor, incomplete and uncertain information systems in a short period of time manner. Design/methodology/approach: The gray forecasting is a dynamical methodology which can be classified into different categories based on their respective functions. The new proposed methodology is made up of three different methodologies including the first-order unbiased GM(1,1), Markov chain and Taylor approximation. In addition to that, two different traditional gray operational mechanisms include GM(1,1) and unbiased GM(1,1) used as the comparisons. The main objective of this study is to forecast gold price demands in a short-term manner based on the data which were taken from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka from October 2017 to December 2017. Findings: The error analysis results suggested that the new proposed HTS_UGM(1,1) is highly accurate (less than 10 percent) with lowest RMSE error values in a one head as well as weakly forecasting's than separate gray forecasting methodologies. Originality/value: The findings suggested that the new proposed hybrid approach is more suitable and effective way for forecasting time series indices than separate time series forecasting methodologies in a short-term manner. {\textcopyright} 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {Cybersecurity is a never-ending battle against attackers, who try to identify and exploit misconfigurations and software vulnerabilities before being patched. In this ongoing conflict, it is important to analyse the properties of the vulnerability time series to understand when information systems are more vulnerable. We study computer systems' software vulnerabilities and probe the relevant National Vulnerability Database (NVD) time-series properties. More specifically, we show through an extensive experimental study based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) database that the relevant systems software time series present significant chaotic properties. Moreover, by defining some systems based on open and closed source software, we compare their chaotic properties resulting in statistical conclusions. The contribution of this novel study is focused on the prepossessing stage of vulnerabilities time series forecasting. The strong evidence of their chaotic properties as derived by this research effort could lead to a deeper analysis to provide additional tools to their forecasting process. {\textcopyright} 2021 by the authors.

abstract = {Time series forecasting has become an important aspect of data analysis and has many real-world applications. However, undesirable missing values are often encountered, which may adversely affect many forecasting tasks. In this study, we evaluate and compare the effects of imputation methods for estimating missing values in a time series. Our approach does not include a simulation to generate pseudo-missing data, but instead perform imputation on actual missing data and measure the performance of the forecasting model created therefrom. In an experiment, therefore, several time series forecasting models are trained using different training datasets prepared using each imputation method. Subsequently, the performance of the imputation methods is evaluated by comparing the accuracy of the forecasting models. The results obtained from a total of four experimental cases show that the k-nearest neighbor technique is the most effective in reconstructing missing data and contributes positively to time series forecasting compared with other imputation methods. {\textcopyright} 2021 Tech Science Press.

abstract = {Background: Time-series forecasting has a critical role during pandemics as it provides essential information that can lead to abstaining from the spread of the disease. The novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, is spreading rapidly all over the world. The countries with dense populations, in particular, such as India, await imminent risk in tackling the epidemic. Different forecasting models are being used to predict future cases of COVID-19. The predicament for most of them is that they are not able to capture both the linear and nonlinear features of the data solely. Methods: We propose an ensemble model integrating an autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) and a nonlinear autoregressive neural network (NAR). ARIMA models are used to extract the linear correlations and the NAR neural network for modeling the residuals of ARIMA containing nonlinear components of the data. Comparison: Single ARIMA model, ARIMA-NAR model and few other existing models which have been applied on the COVID-19 data in different countries are compared based on performance evaluation parameters. Result: The hybrid combination displayed significant reduction in RMSE (16.23%), MAE (37.89%) and MAPE (39.53%) values when compared with single ARIMA model for daily observed cases. Similar results with reduced error percentages were found for daily reported deaths and cases of recovery as well. RMSE value of our hybrid model was lesser in comparison to other models used for forecasting COVID-19 in different countries. Conclusion: Results suggested the effectiveness of the new hybrid model over a single ARIMA model in capturing the linear as well as nonlinear patterns of the COVID-19 data. {\textcopyright} 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {An increasing number of scholars have tried to incorporate external factors affecting the disturbance of a time series into their forecasting models. However, these studies only verify the linkage relationship of two or more time series by empirical tests without providing any theoretical explanation. This makes it difficult to choose a linkage time series without using many tests. In this paper, a novel two-factor fuzzy-fluctuation time series (FFTS) forecasting model is proposed based on the probabilistic linguistic preference relationship (PLPR) and similarity measure. It not only proposes the idea of combining external factors with internal potential trends but also explains the linkage mechanism of time series fluctuations from the perspective of behavioral preference. Specifically, the probabilistic linguistic preference logical relationship (PLPLR) is employed to express the fluctuation behavior rule and preference attribute from the history testing dataset. The Euclidean distance or Hamming distance between the &#x201C;current state&#x201D; and the left side of training PLPLRs is introduced as a similarity comparison method for the identification of appropriate rules. The proposed model is tested using a traditional time series (e.g., the enrollment of the University of Alabama) to compare its performance with existing models. The model is also employed to forecast realistic stock markets, such as the Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX) and Hang Seng Index (HSI). The performance comparison illustrates the effectiveness and universality of the model. Author},

abstract = {Time series analysis models, understands, and predicts phenomena from different domains such as meteorology, medicine, and economics. In this context, Fuzzy Time Series has been standing out due to its capacity of using mathematical functions to represent linguistic variables, resulting in interpretative and more accurate models. Several studies aim at improving time series forecasting using fuzzy set theory, however such efforts were executed solely to obtain modeling improvements in the fuzzification stage, disregarding the stochastic and deterministic influences composing time series to assist the modeling process. In an attempt to fill out such gap, this manuscript employs the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) to extract the deterministic influences which are next modeled using fuzzy clustering to improve time series forecasting. EMD reduces the data imprecision and uncertainty thus helping the fuzzy clustering stage that automatically finds an adequate space partitioning to produce the fuzzy sets. We use Fuzzy C-means to generate fuzzy sets with different characteristics, contributing to improvements in the definition of the number of sets, usually barely explored in the fuzzification stage. Our method was assessed using different validation indices while forecasting time series, which has confirmed promising results and supported the interpretability of data ranges along time. {\textcopyright} 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {wheat, rice etc, has increased in an alarming rate. In this Study, forecasting is done with the help Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM-NN) models on the basis of the historical data of rice cultivation from the year 1950-51 to 2017-18. The well fitted ARIMA models for the parameters such as Area under Cultivation (0,1,1), Production (0,1,1) and Yielding (2,2,1) are obtained from the significant spikes of their respective Auto Correlation Function (ACF) and Partial Auto Correlation Function (PACF) plots. But, the models fitted with a supervised deep learning neural network known as LSTM-NN are found much better time series forecasting model than the ARIMA models. The performances of these models validated with the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values. From the study, the LSTM-NN's are more flexible and able to develop accurate models for predicting the behavior of agricultural parameters than the ARIMA models. {\textcopyright} 2019 Kiran Kumar Paidipati and Arjun Banik licensed to EAI.

abstract = {Criminal activities, be it violent or non-violent are major threats to the safety and security of people. Frequent Crimes are the extreme hindrance to the sustainable development of a nation and thus need to be controlled. Often Police personnel seek the computational solution and tools to realize impending crimes and to perform crime analytics. The developed and developing countries experimenting their tryst with predictive policing in the recent times. With the advent of advanced machine and deep learning algorithms, Time series analysis and building a forecasting model on crime data sets has become feasible. Time series analysis is preferred on this data set as the crime events are recorded with respect to time as significant component. The objective of this paper is to mechanize and automate time series forecasting using a pure DL model. N-Beats Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are the proven ensemble models for time series forecasting. Herein, we had foreseen future trends with better accuracy by building a model using NBeats algorithm on Sacremento crime data set. This study applied detailed data pre-processing steps, presented an extensive set of visualizations and involved hyperparameter tuning. The current study has been compared with the other similar works and had been proved as a better forecasting model. This study varied from the other research studies in the data visualization with the enhanced accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2021},

abstract = {Time series analysis is one of the essential and complicated research methods. It is a well-known fact that improving time series prediction accuracy is a vital yet challenging issue. Recently, soft computing has become popular in time series forecasting in various application areas. Soft computing is a fusion of research of evolutionary and genetic algorithms, neural networks, fuzzy set theory, and fuzzy systems and provides rapid dissemination of results. This study investigates a model for time series water-level prediction using soft computing techniques which is reliable and effective. To illustrate the applicability and capability of soft computing, the Jamuna river, Bangladesh, was used as a case study. We used four areas of the Jamuna river (i.e., Aricha, Bahdurabad, Shariacandi, and Sirajganj) water-level and rainfall events with daily data collected in the past 12 years. In experiments, past 2 to 4 days' time-series wa-ter-level with and without rainfall has been applied to predict 1 to 4 days ahead water-level. The experimental results demonstrated that the adaptive neurofuzzy inference system (ANFIS) performs superiorly to traditional methods, such as nonlinear autoregressive neural network with external input (NARX) and focused time-delay neural network (FTDNN). {\textcopyright} 2021},

abstract = {Influenza is one of the most common infectious diseases worldwide, which causes a considerable economic burden on hospitals and other healthcare costs. Predicting new and urgent trends in epidemiological data is an effective way to prevent influenza outbreaks and protect public health. Traditional autoregressive(AR) methods and new deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) have been actively studied to solve the problem. Most existing studies focus on the short-term prediction of influenza. Recently, Transformer models show superior performance in capturing long-range dependency than RNN models. In this paper, we develop a Transformer-based model, which utilizes the potential of the Transformer to increase the prediction capacity. To fuse information from data of different sources and capture the spatial dependency, we design a sources selection module based on measuring curve similarity. Our model is compared with the widely used AR models and RNN-based models on USA and Japan datasets. Results show that our approach provides approximate performance in short-term forecasting and better performance in long-term forecasting. {\textcopyright} 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Time series forecasting is an important research topic applied to various areas of human knowledge, such as economics, medicine, meteorology, and engineering. The forecasting results can assist the decision-making process, providing useful projections to specialists. In this paper, a hybrid approach named Parallel Recursive Singular Spectrum Analysis and Evolving Neuro-Fuzzy Network (PRSSA+ENFN) for forecasting univariate and multivariate experimental time series, with learning from data streams composed of time series samples, is presented. The adopted methodology considers an evolving neuro-fuzzy basis, i.e., the PRSSA+ENFN adapts, extends, and evolves the fuzzy rule structure from new incoming data of the time series. The time series is subdivided into unobservable components, which are patterns contained in the data, and the neuro-fuzzy network forecasts these component samples so to reconstruct the original time series considering future values. An alternative to determine the specific parameters of PRSSA+ENFN is the application of a genetic algorithm. Four multi-steps ahead forecasting experiments are outlined with univariate and multivariate time series. Finally, some competitive results in relation to other methods in literature are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Although the idea of information granulation has been shown to be a research craze in short-term time series forecasting, it is still urgent to develop a granular framework so that information granulation can characterize the trend distribution of data to the significant extent under a common concept of time. This paper puts forward a novel granulation algorithm involving two-stage partitioning scheme so that information granule established there exhibits well-articulated semantics at the time level, while at the same time, it gives full consideration to the varying patterns of data. On this basis, a new association rule based on this type of information granules is presented. Unlike most fuzzy association rules, the proposed association rules can extract and derive the correlations between two collections of trend features corresponding to the past and future, which is in accord with humans reasoning. Keeping in mind that the prediction process should center on essential rules while freeing from the interference of irrelevant rules, which contributes to a reliable prediction result; thus, a rule selection algorithm is involved so as one makes sure the accuracy and interpretability of the forecasting results. The design of short-term forecasting model based on fuzzy inference system is implemented, where the concept of granulation eliminates the commonly used alternative, i.e., the recursive iterations of one-step prediction. Experimental results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed model. IEEE},

abstract = {According to precision livestock farming principles, it is essential to apply feed intake forecasting processes to real time precision feeding strategies in order to improve the overall efficiency of the livestock feeding chain. Considering the lack of a mechanistic model that predicts daily feed intake in lactating sows, a novel approach combining an online forecasting procedure with an offline learning procedure is proposed. A database of 39,090 lactations, from 6 different farms and containing the first 20 daily feed intake records after farrowing, was used (1) to identify consistent sets of clusters and trajectory curves offline, and (2) to test 3 predictive functions of daily feed intake online. The homogeneity of the clusters resulting from the offline learning procedure was assessed according to Silhouette and Calinski-Harabasz scores. The predictive quality of forecasting functions was assessed with the Mean Error (ME), and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Time-series clustering with k-Shape makes it possible to extract consistent trajectory curves that are scale-, shift- and translate-invariant. The best number of clusters obtained either in a global approach or at farm scale was two. The trajectory curve of the first cluster is characterized by a mostly continuous increase of feed intake over the course of lactation, and the second cluster by a plateau in feed intake starting from about the 10th day of lactation. These identified trajectory curves are consistent with the very few studies available in the literature. When computed with the best forecasting function and farm specific trajectory curves, the ME of feed intake over lactation was −0.08 kg/d, and the corresponding RMSE was 1.06 kg/d. Though variability in feed intake among sows and over the lactation period is high, online forecasting of feed intake can be improved by the use of feed intake trajectory curves. These trajectory curves may be computed on a regular basis with data obtained directly on the farm or on farms with similar practices. The online forecasting procedure requires few computing resources, and could easily be embedded in smart feeder control systems as a practical application in precision feeding systems for lactating sows. {\textcopyright} 2021 The Author(s)},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate whether spatial-temporal dependence models can improve the prediction performance of short-term freight volume forecasts in inland ports. To evaluate the effectiveness of spatial-temporal dependence forecasting, the basic time series forecasting models for use in our comparison were first built based on an autoregression integrated moving average model (ARIMA), a back-propagation neural network (BPNN), and support vector regression (SVR). Subsequently, combining a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) with SVR, an SVR- GBDT model for spatial-temporal dependence forecast was constructed. The SVR model was only used to build a spatial-temporal dependence forecasting model, which does not distinguish spatial and temporal information but instead takes them as data features. Taking inland ports in the Yangtze River as an example, the results indicated that the ports' weekly freight volumes had a higher autocorrelation with the previous 1–3 weeks, and the Pearson correlation values of the ports' weekly cargo volume were mainly located in the interval (0.2–0.5). In addition, the weekly freight volumes of the inland ports were higher depending on their past data, and the spatial-temporal dependence model improved the performance of the weekly freight volume forecasts for the inland river. This study may help to (1) reveal the significance of spatial correlation factors in ports' short-term freight volume predictions, (2) develop prediction models for inland ports, and (3) improve the planning and operation of port entities. {\textcopyright} 2021 by the authors.

In this paper, we develop forecasting models based on statistical (stochastic) methods, sometimes called hard computing, and on a soft method using granular computing. We consider the accuracy of forecasting models as a measure for risk evaluation. It is found that the risk estimation process based on soft methods is simplified and less critical to the question whether the data is true crisp or white noise.},

abstract = {Linear models reach their limitations in applications with nonlinearities in the data. In this paper new empirical evidence is provided on the relative Euro inflation forecasting performance of linear and non-linear models. The well established and widely used univariate ARIMA and multivariate VAR models are used as linear forecasting models whereas neural networks (NN) are used as non-linear forecasting models. It is endeavoured to keep the level of subjectivity in the NN building process to a minimum in an attempt to exploit the full potentials of the NN. It is also investigated whether the historically poor performance of the theoretically superior measure of the monetary services flow, Divisia, relative to the traditional Simple Sum measure could be attributed to a certain extent to the evaluation of these indices within a linear framework. Results obtained suggest that non-linear models provide better within-sample and out-of-sample forecasts and linear models are simply a subset of them. The Divisia index also outperforms the Simple Sum index when evaluated in a non-linear framework. {\textcopyright} 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.},

abstract = {Many statistical applications require the forecast of a random variable of interest over several periods into the future. The sequence of individual forecasts, one period at a time, is called a path forecast, where the term path refers to the sequence of individual future realizations of the random variable. The problem of constructing a corresponding joint prediction region has been rather neglected in the literature so far: such a region is supposed to contain the entire future path with a prespecified probability. We develop bootstrap methods to construct joint prediction regions. The resulting regions are proven to be asymptotically consistent under a mild high-level assumption. We compare the finitesample performance of our joint prediction regions to some previous proposals via Monte Carlo simulations. An empirical application to a real data set is also provided.},

abstract = {Prediction models that capture and use the structure of state-space dynamics can be very effective. In practice, however, one rarely has access to full information about that structure, and accurate reconstruction of the dynamics from scalar time-series data---e.g., via delay-coordinate embedding---can be a real challenge. In this paper, we show that forecast models that employ incomplete embeddings of the dynamics can produce surprisingly accurate predictions of the state of a dynamical system. In particular, we demonstrate the effectiveness of a simple near-neighbor forecast technique that works with a two-dimensional embedding. Even though correctness of the topology is not guaranteed for incomplete reconstructions like this, the dynamical structure that they capture allows for accurate predictions---in many cases, even more accurate than predictions generated using a full embedding. This could be very useful in the context of real-time forecasting, where the human effort required to produce a correct delay-coordinate embedding is prohibitive.},

@article{Ward2014,
abstract = {Short-term forecasts based on time series of counts or survey data are widely used in population biology to provide advice concerning the management, harvest and conservation of natural populations. A common approach to produce these forecasts uses time-series models, of different types, fit to time series of counts. Similar time-series models are used in many other disciplines, however relative to the data available in these other disciplines, population data are often unusually short and noisy and models that perform well for data from other disciplines may not be appropriate for population data. In order to study the performance of time-series forecasting models for natural animal population data, we assembled 2379 time series of vertebrate population indices from actual surveys. Our data were comprised of three vastly different types: highly variable (marine fish productivity), strongly cyclic (adult salmon counts), and small variance but long-memory (bird and mammal counts). We tested the predictive performance of 49 different forecasting models grouped into three broad classes: autoregressive time-series models, non-linear regression-type models and non-parametric time-series models. Low-dimensional parametric autoregressive models gave the most accurate forecasts across a wide range of taxa; the most accurate model was one that simply treated the most recent observation as the forecast. More complex parametric and non-parametric models performed worse, except when applied to highly cyclic species. Across taxa, certain life history characteristics were correlated with lower forecast error; specifically, we found that better forecasts were correlated with attributes of slow growing species: large maximum age and size for fishes and high trophic level for birds. {\textcopyright} 2014 Nordic Society Oikos.},

abstract = {Echo State Networks (ESNs) are a class of single-layer recurrent neural networks with randomly generated internal weights, and a single layer of tuneable outer weights, which are usually trained by regularised linear least squares regression. Remarkably, ESNs still enjoy the universal approximation property despite the training procedure being entirely linear. In this paper, we prove that an ESN trained on a sequence of observations from an ergodic dynamical system (with invariant measure $\mu$) using Tikhonov least squares regression against a set of targets, will approximate the target function in the L2($\mu$) norm. In the special case that the targets are future observations, the ESN is learning the next step map, which allows time series forecasting. We demonstrate the theory numerically by training an ESN using Tikhonov least squares on a sequence of scalar observations of the Lorenz system. {\textcopyright} 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Novel corona-virus (nCOV) has been declared as a pandemic that started from the city Wuhan of China. This deadly virus is infecting people rapidly and has targeted 4.93 million people across the world, with 227 K people being infected only in Italy. Cases of nCOV are quickly increasing whereas the number of nCOV test kits available in hospitals are limited. Under these conditions, an automated system for the classification of patients into nCOV positive and negative cases, is a much needed tool against the pandemic, helping in a selective use of the limited number of test kits. In this research, Convolutional Neural Network-based models (one block VGG, two block VGG, three block VGG, four block VGG, LetNet-5, AlexNet, and Resnet-50) have been employed for the detection of Corona-virus and SARS_MERS infected patients, distinguishing them from the healthy subjects, using lung X-ray scans, which has proven to be a challenging task, due to overlapping characteristics of different corona virus types. Furthermore, LSTM model has been used for time series forecasting of nCOV cases, in the following 10 days, in Italy. The evaluation results obtained, proved that the VGG1 model distinguishes the three classes at an accuracy of almost 91%, as compared to other models, whereas the approach based on the LSTM predicts the number of nCOV cases with 99% accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract = {Since their inception, learning techniques under the reservoir computing paradigm have shown a great modeling capability for recurrent systems without the computing overheads required for other approaches, specially deep neural networks. Among them, different flavors of echo state networks have attracted many stares through time, mainly due to the simplicity and computational efficiency of their learning algorithm. However, these advantages do not compensate for the fact that echo state networks remain as black-box models whose decisions cannot be easily explained to the general audience. This issue is even more involved for multi-layered (also referred to as deep) echo state networks, whose more complex hierarchical structure hinders even further the explainability of their internals to users without expertise in machine learning or even computer science. This lack of explainability can jeopardize the widespread adoption of these models in certain domains where accountability and understandability of machine learning models is a must (e.g., medical diagnosis, social politics). This work addresses this issue by conducting an explainability study of echo state networks when applied to learning tasks with time series, image and video data. Among these tasks, we stress on the latter one (video classification) which, to the best of our knowledge, has never been tackled before with echo state networks in the related literature. Specifically, the study proposes three different techniques capable of eliciting understandable information about the knowledge grasped by these recurrent models, namely potential memory, temporal patterns and pixel absence effect. Potential memory addresses questions related to the effect of the reservoir size in the capability of the model to store temporal information, whereas temporal patterns unveil the recurrent relationships captured by the model over time. Finally, pixel absence effect attempts at evaluating the effect of the absence of a given pixel when the echo state network model is used for image and video classification. The benefits of the proposed suite of techniques are showcased over three different domains of applicability: time series modeling, image and, for the first time in the related literature, video classification. The obtained results reveal that the proposed techniques not only allow for an informed understanding of the way these models work, but also serve as diagnostic tools capable of detecting issues inherited from data (e.g., presence of hidden bias). {\textcopyright} 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

We extend our comparisons using combined and model-averaging models. The forecasting models are applied on eight implied volatility indices of the most important stock market indices. We provide evidence that the non-parametric models of Singular Spectrum Analysis combined with Holt-Winters (SSA-HW) exhibit statistically superior predictive ability for the one and ten trading days ahead forecasting horizon. By contrast, the model-averaged forecasts based on both parametric (Autoregressive Integrated model) and non-parametric models (SSA-HW) are able to provide improved forecasts, particularly for the ten trading days ahead forecasting horizon. For robustness purposes, we build two trading strategies based on the aforementioned forecasts, which further confirm that the SSA-HW and the ARI-SSA-HW are able to generate significantly higher net daily returns in the out-of-sample period.},

abstract = {Abstract Energy planning models (EPMs) play an indispensable role in policy formulation and energy sector development. The forecasting of energy demand and supply is at the heart of an EPM. Different forecasting methods, from statistical to machine learning have been applied in the past. The selection of a forecasting method is mostly based on data availability and the objectives of the tool and planning exercise. We present a systematic and critical review of forecasting methods used in 483 EPMs. The methods were analyzed for forecasting accuracy; applicability for temporal and spatial predictions; and relevance to planning and policy objectives. Fifty different forecasting methods were identified. Artificial neural network (ANN) is the most widely used method, which is applied in 40% of the reviewed EPMs. The other popular methods, in descending order, are: support vector machine (SVM), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), fuzzy logic (FL), linear regression (LR), genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), grey prediction (GM) and autoregressive moving average (ARMA). Regarding accuracy, computational intelligence (CI) methods demonstrate better performance than that of the statistical ones, in particular for parameters with greater variability in the source data. Moreever, hybrid methods yield better accuracy than that of the stand-alone ones. Statistical methods are used for only short and medium range, while CI methods are preferable for all temporal forecasting ranges (short, medium and long). Based on objective, most EPMs focused on energy demand and load forecasting. In terms, geographical coverage, the highest number of EPMs were developed in China. However, collectively, more models were established for the developed countries than the developing ones. Findings would benefit researchers and professionals in gaining an appreciation of the forecasting methods and enable them to select appropriate method(s) to meet their needs.},

abstract = {This paper derives optimal forecast combinations based on stochastic dominance efficiency (SDE) analysis with differential forecast weights for different quantiles of forecast error distribution. For the optimal forecast combination, SDE will minimize the cumulative density functions of the levels of loss at different quantiles of the forecast error distribution by combining different time-series model-based forecasts. Using two exchange rate series on weekly data for the Japanese yen/US dollar and US dollar/Great Britain pound, we find that the optimal forecast combinations with SDE weights perform better than different forecast selection and combination methods for the majority of the cases at different quantiles of the error distribution. However, there are also some very few cases where some other forecast selection and combination model performs equally well at some quantiles of the forecast error distribution. Different forecasting period and quadratic loss function are used to obtain optimal forecast combinations, and results are robust to these choices. The out-of-sample performance of the SDE forecast combinations is also better than that of the other forecast selection and combination models we considered.},

These spatio-temporal models are proposed and applied for forecasting monthly oil production data at three drilling wells in East Java, Indonesia. There are 60 observations that be divided to two parts, i.e. the first 50 observations for training data and the last 10 observations for testing data. The results show that FFNN-GSTAR(1 1 ) and FFNN-VAR(1) as nonlinear spatio-temporal models tend to give more accurate forecast than VAR(1) and GSTAR(1 1 ) as linear spatio-temporal models. Moreover, further research about nonlinear spatio-temporal models based on neural networks and GSTAR is needed for developing new hybrid models that could improve the forecast accuracy.},

abstract = {The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the market value of all goods and services produced within the boundary of a nation in a year. This paper aims to apply time series tools and forecast GDP growth in the Bangladesh economy. Forecasting of time series is an important topic in macroeconomics. We collected the data from World Development Indicators (WDI) and it has been collected over a period of 37 years by WDI, World Bank. Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) and Phillips–Perron (PP) tests were applied to investigate the stationary character of the data. Stata and R statistical software was used to build a class of Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and exponential smoothing methods to model the GDP growth. We applied several ARIMA (P, I, Q) models and employed the ARIMA (1,1,1) model as best for forecasting. This ARIMA (1,1,1) model was chosen based on the minimum values of the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Also, we applied the Exponential Smoothing to forecast the GDP growth rate. In addition, among the Exponential Smoothing models, the triple exponential model better analyzed the data based on lowest Sum of Square Error (SSE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Using these models, the values of future GDP growth rates are forecasted. Statistical results show that Bangladesh's GDP growth rate is an increasing trend that will continue rising in the future. This finding will help policymakers and academicians to formulate economic and business strategies more precisely.

abstract = {With the globally increasing electricity demand, its related uncertainties are on the rise as well. Therefore, a deeper insight of load forecasting techniques for projecting future electricity demands becomes imperative for business entities and policy makers. The electricity demand is governed by a set of different variables or “electricity demand determinants”. These demand determinants depend on forecasting horizons (long term, medium term, and short term), the load aggregation level, climate, and socio-economic activities. In this paper, a review of different electricity demand forecasting methodologies is provided in the context of a group of low and middle income countries. The article presents a comprehensive literature review by tabulating the different demand determinants used in different countries and forecasting the trends and techniques used in these countries. A comparative review of these forecasting methodologies over different time horizons reveals that the time series modeling approach has been extensively used while forecasting for long and medium terms. For short term forecasts, artificial intelligence-based techniques remain prevalent in the literature. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of the demand determinants in these countries indicates a frequent use of determinants like the population, GDP, weather, and load data over different time horizons. Following the analysis, potential research gaps are identified, and recommendations are provided, accordingly.},

abstract = {Abstract Kernel analog forecasting (KAF), alternatively known as kernel principal component regression, is a kernel method used for nonparametric statistical forecasting of dynamically generated time series data. This paper synthesizes descriptions of kernel methods and Koopman operator theory in order to provide a single consistent account of KAF. The framework presented here illuminates the property of the KAF method that, under measure-preserving and ergodic dynamics, it consistently approximates the conditional expectation of observables that are acted upon by the Koopman operator of the dynamical system and are conditioned on the observed data at forecast initialization. More precisely, KAF yields optimal predictions, in the sense of minimal root mean square error with respect to the invariant measure, in the asymptotic limit of large data. The presented framework facilitates, moreover, the analysis of generalization error and quantification of uncertainty. Extensions of KAF to the construction of conditional variance and conditional probability functions, as well as to non-symmetric kernels, are also shown. Illustrations of various aspects of KAF are provided with applications to simple examples, namely a periodic flow on the circle and the chaotic Lorenz 63 system.},

In addition to the complex intraday, intraweek and intrayear seasonal cycles, call arrival data typically contain a large number of anomalous days, driven by the occurrence of holidays, special events, promotional activities and system failures. This study evaluates the use of a variety of univariate time series forecasting methods for forecasting intraday call arrivals in the presence of such outliers. Apart from established, statistical methods, we consider artificial neural networks (ANNs). Based on the modelling flexibility of the latter, we introduce and evaluate different methods to encode the outlying periods. Using intraday arrival series from a call centre operated by one of Europe's leading entertainment companies, we provide new insights on the impact of outliers on the performance of established forecasting methods. Results show that ANNs forecast call centre data accurately, and are capable of modelling complex outliers using relatively simple outlier modelling approaches. We argue that the relative complexity of ANNs over standard statistical models is offset by the simplicity of coding multiple and unknown effects during outlying periods.},

abstract = {Abstract Finding suitable forecasting methods for an effective management of energy resources is of paramount importance for improving the efficiency in energy consumption and decreasing its impact on the environment. Natural gas is one of the main sources of electrical energy in Algeria and worldwide. To address this demand, this paper introduces a novel hybrid forecasting approach that resolves the two-stage method's deficiency, by designing a Multi Layered Perceptron (MLP) neural network as a nonlinear forecasting monitor. This model estimates the next day gas consumption profile and selects one of several local models to perform the forecast. The study focuses firstly on an analysis and clustering of natural gas daily consumption profiles, and secondly on building a comprehensive Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent models according to load behavior. The results are compared with four benchmark approaches: the MLP neural network approach, LSTM, seasonal time series with exogenous variables models and multiple linear regression models. Compared with these alternative approaches and their high dependence on historical loads, the proposed approach presents a new efficient functionality. It estimates the next day consumption profile, which leads to a significant improvement of the forecasting accuracy, especially for days with exceptional customers consumption behavior change.},

abstract = {This study presents a hybrid forecasting method that was designed and fine-tuned using the fuzzy set theory, combined with the classical methodology of time series modeling, to increase the accuracy of the forecasting algorithm. Thus, a fuzzy identification strategy is proposed, which considers the following (among other parameters): the extended autocorrelation function and the number of triangular fuzzy sets. Using a non-iterative procedure based on a fuzzy version of the extended autocorrelation function, the interpolation and generalization capabilities of fuzzy systems were exploited in order to obtain a robust forecast, even when considering a time series with insufficient data. In order to increase the accuracy of the forecasting algorithm, several parameters were tested and optimized using computational simulations. Several parameters inherent to the forecasting algorithm proposed in this study were tested and optimized. To evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology, two case studies were performed on two databases that are available in the literature. The proposed fuzzy forecasting algorithm yielded very good results, given the low forecasting errors that were returned by the identified models, especially when compared with the conventional statistical methodologies and other fuzzy forecasting methods that are established in the literature. {\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The paper examines the impact of integration of macroeconomic indicators on the accuracy of container throughput time series forecasting model. For this purpose, a Dynamic factor analysis and AutoRegressive Integrated Moving-Average model with eXogenous inputs (ARIMAX) are used. Both methodologies are integrated into a novel four-stage heuristic procedure. Firstly, dynamic factors are extracted from external macroeconomic indicators influencing the observed throughput. Secondly, the family of ARIMAX models of different orders is generated based on the derived factors. In the third stage, the diagnostic and goodness-of-fit testing is applied, which includes statistical criteria such as fit performance, information criteria, and parsimony. Finally, the best model is heuristically selected and tested on the real data of the Port of Koper. The results show that by applying macroeconomic indicators into the forecasting model, more accurate future throughput forecasts can be achieved. The model is also used to produce future forecasts for the next four years indicating a more oscillatory behaviour in (2018-2020). Hence, care must be taken concerning any bigger investment decisions initiated from the management side. It is believed that the proposed model might be a useful reinforcement of the existing forecasting module in the observed port. {\textcopyright} 2017, Faculty of Transport and Traffic Engineering.

It provides data for the research of time series analysis method, and promotes the development of time series research. Due to the generation of highly complex and large-scale time series data, the construction of forecasting models for time series data brings greater challenges. The main challenges of time series modeling are high complexity of time series data, low accuracy and poor generalization ability of prediction model.

abstract = {To enhance the accuracy of intuitionistic fuzzy time series forecasting model, this paper analyses the influence of universe of discourse partition and compares with relevant literature. Traditional models usually partition the global universe of discourse, which is not appropriate for all objectives. For example, the universe of the secular trend model is continuously variational. In addition, most forecasting methods rely on prior information, i.e., fuzzy relationship groups (FRG). Numerous relationship groups lead to the explosive growth of relationship library in a linear model and increase the computational complexity. To overcome problems above and ascertain an appropriate order, an intuitionistic fuzzy time series forecasting model based on order decision and adaptive partition algorithm is proposed. By forecasting the vector operator matrix, the proposed model can adjust partitions and intervals adaptively. The proposed model is tested on student enrollments of Alabama dataset, typical seasonal dataset Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX) and a secular trend dataset of total retail sales for social consumer goods in China. Experimental results illustrate the validity and applicability of the proposed method for different patterns of dataset.},

There is a whole field of research focused on this area, called technology forecasting, in which bibliometrics plays an important role. Within that framework, this paper presents a forecasting approach focused on a specific field of technology forecasting: research activity related to an emerging technology. This approach is based on four research fields—bibliometrics, text mining, time series modelling and time series forecasting—and is structured in five interlinked steps that generate a continuous flow of information. The main milestone is the generation of time series that measure the level of research activity and can be used for forecasting. The usefulness of this approach is shown by applying it to an emerging technology: cloud computing. The results enable the technology to be structured into five main sub-technologies which are characterised through five time series. Time series analysis of the trends related to each sub-technology shows that Privacy and Security has been the most active sub-technology to date in this area and is expected to maintain its level of interest in the near future.},

Many machine learning techniques have been used in this area to predict the stock market price, including regression algorithms which can be useful tools to provide good performance of financial time series prediction. Support Vector Regression is one of the most powerful algorithms in machine learning. There have been countless successes in utilizing SVR algorithm for stock market prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach based on machine learning and filtering techniques. Our proposed approach combines Support Vector Regression and Hodrick–Prescott filter in order to optimize the prediction of stock price. To assess the performance of this proposed approach, we have conducted several experiments using real world datasets. The principle objective of this paper is to demonstrate the improvement in predictive performance of stock market and verify the works of our proposed model in comparison with other optimized models.

abstract = {Over the past few decades, a large literature has evolved to forecast time series using various linear, nonlinear and hybrid linear–nonlinear models. Recently, hybrid models by suitably combining linear models like autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) with nonlinear models like artificial neural network (ANN) have become popular due to superior performance than individual models. These models assume the time series to be a sum of a linear and a nonlinear component. However, a real world time series may be purely linear or purely nonlinear or often contains a combination of linear and nonlinear patterns. Motivated by this need, a new hybrid methodology is developed by combining linear and nonlinear exponential smoothing models from innovation state space (ETS) with ANN. The proposed hybrid ETS–ANN model glorifies the chances of capturing different combination of linear and/or nonlinear patterns in time series. This is because both ETS and ANN models have linear as well as nonlinear modeling capability. However, ANN cannot handle linear patterns equally well as nonlinear patterns. Therefore, in the proposed method, first ETS is applied to the given time series and predictions are obtained. This enhances the chances of capturing existing linear patterns (if any) well using linear ETS models. Then residual error sequence is calculated by subtracting the ETS-predictions from the original series. The residual error sequence obtained is modeled by ANN. Then final prediction is obtained by combining the ETS-predictions with ANN-predictions. Sixteen time series datasets are used for comparative performance analysis of the proposed methodology with ARIMA, ETS, multilayer perceptron(MLP) and some existing hybrid ARIMA–ANN models. Experimental results show that the proposed hybrid model shows statistically promising result for the datasets used.},

abstract = {Conventional time series forecast models can hardly develop the inherent rules of complex non-linear dynamic systems because the strict assumptions they need cannot always be met in reality, whereas fuzzy time series (FTS) techniques can be used even the records of times series have uncertainty and instability since they do not need strict assumptions. In previous study of FTS, the process of aggregating the past observations and assigning proper weights of fuzzy logical relationship groups are ignored, which may lead to poor forecasting accuracy since they are important aspects in time series prediction and analysis where determination of future trends depends only on past observations. In this paper, a novel high-order FTS model is constructed to make time series forecasting. Specifically, by applying the harmony search intelligence algorithm, the optimal lengths of intervals are tuned. Moreover, regularly increasing monotonic quantifiers are employed on fuzzy sets to obtain the weights of ordered weighted aggregation. Simultaneously, the weights of right-hand side of fuzzy logical relationship groups are explored to compensate the presence of bias in the prediction. In the part of empirical analysis, the developed model was applied to predict three well-known time series: numbers of enrollment of Alabama University, TAIEX and electricity load demand of New South Wales and the results obtained were compared with several counterparts, including some old and recently developed models. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed model cannot only achieve higher accuracy of prediction, but also capture the fuzzy features and characters.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a new methodology for modelling based on an evolving Neuro-Fuzzy Takagi–Sugeno (NF-TS) network used for seasonal time series forecasting. The NF-TS considers the unobservable components extracted from the time series data to evolve, that is, to adapt and to adjust its structure, where the fuzzy rules number of this network can increase or decrease according to components behaviour. The method used to extract these components is a recursive version, proposed in this paper, based on the Spectral Singular Analysis (SSA) technique. The NF-TS network adopts the principle divide to conquer, where it divides a complex problem into subproblems easier to deal, forecasting separately each unobservable component, because they present dynamic behaviours that are simpler to forecast. The consequent propositions of fuzzy rules are linear state space models, where the states are the unobservable components data. When there are available observations from the time series, the training stage of NF-TS is performed, i.e., the NF-TS evolves its structure and adapts its parameters to carry out the mapping between the components data and the available sample of original time series. On the other hand, if this observation is not available, the network considers the forecasting stage, keeping its structure fixed and using the states of consequent fuzzy rules to feedback the unobservable components data to NF-TS. The NF-TS was evaluated and compared with other recent and traditional techniques for seasonal time series forecasting, obtaining competitive and advantageous results in relation to other papers. This paper also presents a case study about real-time detection of anomalies based on a patient electrocardiogram data.},

abstract = {One of the most widely used standard procedures for model evaluation in classification and regression is K-fold cross-validation (CV). However, when it comes to time series forecasting, because of the inherent serial correlation and potential non-stationarity of the data, its application is not straightforward and often replaced by practitioners in favour of an out-of-sample (OOS) evaluation. It is shown that for purely autoregressive models, the use of standard K-fold CV is possible provided the models considered have uncorrelated errors. Such a setup occurs, for example, when the models nest a more appropriate model. This is very common when Machine Learning methods are used for prediction, and where CV can control for overfitting the data. Theoretical insights supporting these arguments are presented, along with a simulation study and a real-world example. It is shown empirically that K-fold CV performs favourably compared to both OOS evaluation and other time-series-specific techniques such as non-dependent cross-validation.},

abstract = {Streaming video services represent a very large fraction of global bandwidth consumption. Due to the exploding demands of mobile video streaming services, coupled with limited bandwidth availability, video streams are often transmitted through unreliable, low-bandwidth networks. This unavoidably leads to two types of major streaming-related impairments: compression artifacts and/or rebuffering events. In streaming video applications, the end-user is a human observer; hence being able to predict the subjective Quality of Experience (QoE) associated with streamed videos could lead to the creation of perceptually optimized resource allocation strategies driving higher quality video streaming services. We propose a variety of recurrent dynamic neural networks that conduct continuous-time subjective QoE prediction. By formulating the problem as one of time-series forecasting, we train a variety of recurrent neural networks and non-linear autoregressive models to predict QoE using several recently developed subjective QoE databases. These models combine multiple, diverse neural network inputs, such as predicted video quality scores, rebuffering measurements, and data related to memory and its effects on human behavioral responses, using them to predict QoE on video streams impaired by both compression artifacts and rebuffering events. Instead of finding a single time-series prediction model, we propose and evaluate ways of aggregating different models into a forecasting ensemble that delivers improved results with reduced forecasting variance. We also deploy appropriate new evaluation metrics for comparing time-series predictions in streaming applications. Our experimental results demonstrate improved prediction performance that approaches human performance.

abstract = {Time series forecasting has been an active research area for decades, receiving considerable attention from very different domains, such as econometrics, statistics, engineering, mathematics, medicine and social sciences. Moreover, with the emergence of the big data era, the automatic identification with the appropriate techniques remains an intermediate compulsory stage of any big data implementation with predictive analytics purposes. Extensive research on model selection and combination has revealed the benefits of such techniques in terms of forecast accuracy and reliability. Several criteria for model selection have been proposed and used for decades with very good results. Akaike information criterion and Schwarz Bayesian criterion are two of the most popular criteria. However, research on the combination of several criteria along with other sources of information in a unified methodology remains scarce. This study proposes a new model selection approach that combines different criteria using a support vector machine (SVM). Given a set of candidate models, rather than considering any individual criterion, an SVM is trained at each forecasting origin to select the best model. This methodology will be particularly interesting for scenarios with highly volatile demand because it allows changing the model when it does not fit the data sufficiently well, thereby reducing the risk of misusing modeling techniques in the automatic processing of large datasets. The effects of the proposed approach are empirically explored using a set of representative forecasting methods and a dataset of 229 weekly demand series from a leading household and personal care manufacturer in the UK. Our findings suggest that the proposed approach results in more robust predictions with lower mean forecasting error and biases than base forecasts.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an intelligent model search engine (IMSE), an integrated model selection algorithm, subject to the out of sample predictive performance and given set of explanatory variables for forecasting crude oil prices. In the conventional applications of energy price forecasting, models are selected based on preliminary assumptions on causality and model structure (e.g. lag length in lagged variables). Relaxation of those assumptions would cause over-fitting and reduce the degree of freedom. Considering the ultimate objective of forecasting models, any variations of models may be tested in the out-of-sample period, and the optimization problem can be redefined as minimization of post-sample error metric in a validation set. By this, data mining would be a legitimate operation for economic forecasting, and it also proves required conditions usually tested by diagnostic tests such as Akaike Information Criterion for model quality. IMSE is a multi-input/single output difference equation based approach which allows users to test various models (for given set of explanatory variables) as well as various order of lagged inputs (lag length) without a priori assumption or theoretical basis except defining set of potential inputs. Finally, it selects the best model subject to predictive accuracy in a validation set. Empirical results indicated that the proposed algorithm significantly outperformed a broad range of benchmark methodologies as well as proving that certain assumptions of econometric approach (e.g. statistical significance of explanatory variables) are independent of predictive performance.},

abstract = {Oil is an important energy commodity. The difficulties of forecasting oil prices stem from the nonlinearity and non-stationarity of their dynamics. However, the oil prices are closely correlated with global financial markets and economic conditions, which provides us with sufficient information to predict them. Traditional models are linear and parametric, and are not very effective in predicting oil prices. To address these problems, this study developed a new strategy. Deep (or hierarchical) multiple kernel learning (DMKL) was used to predict the oil price time series. Traditional methods from statistics and machine learning usually involve shallow models; however, they are unable to fully represent complex, compositional, and hierarchical data features. This explains why traditional methods fail to track oil price dynamics. This study aimed to solve this problem by combining deep learning and multiple kernel machines using information from oil, gold, and currency markets. DMKL is good at exploiting multiple information sources. It can effectively identify the relevant information and simultaneously select an apposite data representation. The kernels of DMKL were embedded in a directed acyclic graph (DAG), which is a deep model and efficient at representing complex and compositional data features. This provided a solid foundation for extracting the key features of oil price dynamics. By using real data for empirical testing, our new system robustly outperformed traditional models and significantly reduced the forecasting errors.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a speed prediction model using auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and neural networks for estimating the futuristic speed of the nodes in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). The speed prediction promotes the route discovery process for the selection of moderate mobility nodes to provide reliable routing. The ARIMA is a time-series forecasting approach, which uses autocorrelations to predict the future speed of nodes. In the paper, the ARIMA model and recurrent neural network (RNN) trains the random waypoint mobility (RWM) dataset to forecast the mobility of the nodes. The proposed ARIMA model designs the prediction models through varying the delay terms and changing the numbers of hidden neuron in RNN. The Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), auto-correlation function (ACF), and partial auto-correlation function (PACF) parameters evaluate the predicted mobility dataset to estimate the model quality and reliability. The different scenarios of changing node speed evaluate the performance of prediction models. Performance results indicate that the ARIMA forecasted speed values almost match with the RWM observed speed values than RNN values. The graphs exhibit that the ARIMA predicted mobility values have lower error metrics such as mean square error (MSE), root MSE (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) than RNN predictions. It yields higher futuristic speed prediction precision rate of 17% to 24% throughout the time series as compared with RNN. Further, the proposed model extensively compares with the existing works.},

Forecasting (or prediction), similarly to other data mining tasks, uses empirical evidence to select the most suitable model for a problem at hand since no modeling method can be considered as the best. However, according to our systematic literature review of the last decade, few scientific publications rigorously expose the benefits and limitations of the most popular algorithms for time series prediction. At the same time, there is a limited performance record of these models when applied to complex and highly nonlinear data. In this paper, we present one of the most extensive, impartial and comprehensible experimental evaluations ever done in the time series prediction field. From 95 datasets, we evaluate eleven predictors, seven parametric and four non-parametric, employing two multi-step-ahead projection strategies and four performance evaluation measures. We report many lessons learned and recommendations concerning the advantages, drawbacks, and the best conditions for the use of each model. The results show that SARIMA is the only statistical method able to outperform, but without a statistical difference, the following machine learning algorithms: ANN, SVM, and kNN-TSPI. However, such forecasting accuracy comes at the expense of a larger number of parameters. The evaluated datasets, as well detailed results achieved by different indexes as MSE, Theil's U coefficient, POCID, and a recently-proposed multi-criteria performance measure are available online in our repository. Such repository is another contribution of this paper since other researchers can replicate our results and evaluate their methods more rigorously. The findings of this study will impact further research on this topic since they provide a broad insight into models selection, parameters setting, evaluation measures, and experimental setup.},

abstract = {Wind energy, acknowledged as a promising form of renewable energy and the fastest-growing clean method for electricity generation, has attracted considerable attention from many scientists and researchers in recent decades. However, wind energy forecasting is still a challenging task owing to its inherent features of non-linearity and randomness. Therefore, this study develops a hybrid wind energy forecasting and analysis system including a deterministic forecasting module and an uncertainty analysis module to mitigate the challenges in existing studies. In particular, these challenges are as follows: (1) It is difficult to guarantee that the data characteristics underlying the time series are effectively extracted; (2) in the modeling of each subseries, i.e., when the original data is decomposed into some time series, forecasting accuracy and stability are not simultaneously considered, and thus, they are not properly modeled; and (3) the best function to perform a deterministic forecasting and uncertainty analysis based on the forecaster of each subseries is unknown. The developed hybrid system consists of three steps: First, data preprocessing is conducted to capture and mine the main feature of the wind energy time series and weaken the noises' negative effects; second, multi-objective optimization is proposed to achieve the forecasting of each subseries with improvements in accuracy and stability; finally, search for the best function, which obtains the deterministic forecasting and uncertainty analysis results using an optimized extreme learning machine based on different modeling objectives, is conducted. Experimental simulations are performed using data from three sites in a real wind farm, which indicate that the developed system has a better performance in engineering applications than that of other methods. Furthermore, this system could not only be used as an effective tool for wind energy deterministic forecasting and uncertainty analysis, but also for other engineering application areas in the future.},

Global fire models focus on longer timescale simulations and can be very complex. Regional fire models concentrate on seasonal forecasting but usually require inputs that are not available in many places. Motivated by the possibility of having a simple, fast, and general model, we propose a seasonal fire prediction methodology based on time series forecasting methods. It consists of dividing the studied area into grid cells and extracting time series of fire counts to fit the forecasting models. We apply these models to estimate the fire season severity (FSS) from each cell, here defined as the sum of the fire counts detected in a season. Experimental results using a global fire detection data set show that the proposed approach can predict FSS with a relatively low error in many regions. The proposed approach is reasonably fast and can be applied on a global scale.},

abstract = {Water Utilities (WU) are responsible for supplying water for residential, commercial and industrial use guaranteeing the sanitary and quality standards established by different regulations. To assure the satisfaction of such standards a set of quality sensors that monitor continuously the Water Distribution System (WDS) are used. Unfortunately, those sensors require continuous maintenance in order to guarantee their right and reliable operation. In order to program the maintenance of those sensors taking into account the health state of the sensor, a prognosis system should be deployed. Moreover, before proceeding with the prognosis of the sensors, the data provided with those sensors should be validated using data from other sensors and models. This paper provides an advanced data analytics framework that will allow us to diagnose water quality sensor faults and to detect water quality events. Moreover, a data-driven prognosis module will be able to assess the sensitivity degradation of the chlorine sensors estimating the remaining useful life (RUL), taking into account uncertainty quantification, that allows us to program the maintenance actions based on the state of health of sensors instead on a regular basis. The fault and event detection module is based on a methodology that combines time and spatial models obtained from historical data that are integrated with a discrete-event system and are able to distinguish between a quality event or a sensor fault. The prognosis module analyses the quality sensor time series forecasting the degradation and therefore providing a predictive maintenance plan avoiding unsafe situations in the WDS.},

This makes it difficult to forecast accurately. The purpose of this paper is to forecast container throughput using deep learning methods and benchmark its performance over other traditional time-series methods. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are implemented to forecast container throughput. The container throughput data of the Port of Singapore are used for empirical analysis. The forecasting performance of the LSTM model is compared with seven different time-series forecasting methods, namely, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), simple exponential smoothing, Holt–Winter's, error-trend-seasonality, trigonometric regressors (TBATS), neural network (NN) and ARIMA + NN. The relative error matrix is used to analyze the performance of the different models with respect to bias, accuracy and uncertainty. Findings: The results showed that LSTM outperformed all other benchmark methods. From a statistical perspective, the Diebold–Mariano test is also conducted to further substantiate better forecasting performance of LSTM over other counterpart methods. Originality/value: The proposed study is a contribution to the literature on the container throughput forecasting and adds value to the supply chain theory of forecasting.

Support vector machine (SVM) is one of the common data mining methods in the field of machine learning. It has outstanding advantages compared with other methods and it is widely used in various fields. However, there are still many problems in the practical application of the method, and the model itself has many fields that need to be improved. The purpose of this paper is to accurately predict the trend of stock prices, providing a reference model for the trend of stock market and the tracking method of stock price prediction, and provide value reference for research on the forecasting model of stock market and investor's investment decision. Research using a combined model to predict stock market trends whether will have a significant improvement compared to using a single model to forecast that. The method of this paper is to analyze the shortcomings of current stock market forecasting methods and standard support vector machines firstly, at the same time, based on this, a cumulative auto-regressive moving average is proposed, which combines the least squares support vector machine synthesis model (ARI-MA-LS-SVM) to make basic predictions for the stock market. Secondly, process the data first for the predictive indicators by using cumulative auto-regressive moving average. Then, use the least squares support vector machine of simple indicator system to predict stock price fluctuations. Therefore, it can be concluded that the combined model based on ARI-MA-LS-SVM is more suitable for stock price forecasting than the single forecasting model, and the actual performance is better. At the same time, a large number of simulation experiments show that the algorithm of multiple model's fusion can achieve the expected effect, which indicate that the model has universal applicability, market applicability and stability feasibility. This model can bring some guidance and reference value for many investors and market regulators.},

We highlight advantages and limitations of each method and discuss their implementation for parallel computing architectures. We quantify the relative prediction accuracy of these algorithms for the long-term forecasting of chaotic systems using as benchmarks the Lorenz-96 and the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky (KS) equations. We find that, when the full state dynamics are available for training, RC outperforms BPTT approaches in terms of predictive performance and in capturing of the long-term statistics, while at the same time requiring much less training time. However, in the case of reduced order data, large scale RC models can be unstable and more likely than the BPTT algorithms to diverge. In contrast, RNNs trained via BPTT show superior forecasting abilities and capture well the dynamics of reduced order systems. Furthermore, the present study quantifies for the first time the Lyapunov Spectrum of the KS equation with BPTT, achieving similar accuracy as RC. This study establishes that RNNs are a potent computational framework for the learning and forecasting of complex spatiotemporal systems.},

abstract = {Lifestyle development and increasing urbanisation and consumption of fossil fuels, monitoring and controlling air pollution have become more important. This study has used the available data of key pollutants to predict their future status through time-series modelling. Most researchers have employed Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average and Logistic Regression techniques, and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System has rarely been used to analyse time-series data. Traditional time-series forecasting models assume a linear relationship between variables, while there are nonlinear and complex components in air pollution modelling. This study aimed to respond to this limitation by improving the accuracy of the daily prediction of pollutants via time-series data analysis by using Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System modelling. A nonlinear multivariate regression model was developed and experimentally refined to obtain the least error possible. Data on pollutants containing CO, SO2, O3, and NO2 are collected from a single monitoring point in Tehran. The process of the developing the model begins by breaking down the data sets into training, testing, and validation set at a random ratio of 80%, 10%, and 10%. For the prediction of CO, SO2, O3, and NO2, the coefficients of determination are calculated as 0.8686, 0.8011, 0.8350 and 0.7640, and these values for the semi-experimental model were 0.8445, 0.8001, 0.7830 and 0.7602. According to the performance indicators of both models, Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System is more accurate in predicting time-series data than regression models. Reliable forecasting of future air quality would help governments develop policies and regulations to protect humans and ecosystems and achieve sustainable development.},

abstract = {We propose a time series forecasting method for the future prices of agricultural products and present the criteria by which forecasted future time series are evaluated in the context of statistical characteristics. Time series forecasting of agricultural products has the basic importance in maintaining the sustainability of agricultural production. The prices of agricultural products show seasonality in their time series, and conventional methods such as the auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA or the Box Jenkins method) have tried to exploit this feature for forecasting. We expect that recurrent neural networks, representing the latest machine learning technology, can forecast future time series better than conventional methods. The measures used in evaluating the forecasted results are also of importance. In literature, the accuracy determined by the error rate at a specific time point in the future, is widely used for evaluation. We predict that, in addition to the error rate, the criterion for conservation of the statistical characteristics of the probability distribution function from the original past time series to the future time series in the forecasted future is also important. This is because some time series have a non-Gaussian probability distribution (such as the L{\'{e}}vy stable distribution) as a characteristic of the target system; for example, market prices on typical days change slightly, however on certain occasions, change dramatically. We implemented two methods for time series forecasting based on recurrent neutral network (RNN), one of which is called time-alignment of time point forecast (TATP), and another one is called direct future time series forecast (DFTS). They were evaluated using the two aforementioned criteria consisting of the accuracy and the conservation of the statistical characteristics of the probability distribution function. We found that after intensive training, TATP of LTSM shows superior performance in not only accuracy, but also the conservation compared to TATP of other RNNs. In DFTS, DFTS of LSTM cannot show the best performance in accuracy in RMS sense, but it shows superior performance in other criteria. The results suggest that the selection of forecasting methods depends on the evaluation criteria and that combinations of forecasting methods is useful based on the application. The advantage of our method is that the required length of time series for training is enough short, namely, we can forecast the whole cycle of future time series after training with even less than the half of the cycle, and it can be applied to the field where enough numbers of continuous data are not available.},

abstract = {Unemployment has always been a very focused issue causing a nation as a whole to lose its economic and financial contribution. Unemployment rate prediction of a country is a crucial factor for the country's economic and financial growth planning and a challenging job for policymakers. Traditional stochastic time series models, as well as modern nonlinear time series techniques, were employed for unemployment rate forecasting previously. These macroeconomic data sets are mostly nonstationary and nonlinear in nature. Thus, it is atypical to assume that an individual time series forecasting model can generate a white noise error. This paper proposes an integrated approach based on linear and nonlinear models that can predict the unemployment rates more accurately. The proposed hybrid model of the unemployment rate can improve their forecasts by reflecting the unemployment rate's asymmetry. The model's applications are shown using seven unemployment rate data sets from various countries, namely, Canada, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, and Switzerland. The results of computational tests are very promising in comparison with other conventional methods. The results for asymptotic stationarity of the proposed hybrid approach using Markov chains and nonlinear time series analysis techniques are given in this paper which guarantees that the proposed model cannot show ‘explosive' behavior or growing variance over time.},

While no single time series modeling method is universal to all types of dynamics, forecasting using an ensemble of several methods is often seen as a compromise. Instead of fixing ensemble diversity and size, we propose to predict these aspects adaptively using meta-learning. Meta-learning here considers two separate random forest regression models, built on 390 time-series features, to rank 22 univariate forecasting methods and recommend ensemble size. The forecasting ensemble is consequently formed from methods ranked as the best, and forecasts are pooled using either simple or weighted average (with a weight corresponding to reciprocal rank). The proposed approach was tested on 12561 micro-economic time-series (expanded to 38633 for various forecasting horizons) of M4 competition where meta-learning outperformed Theta and Comb benchmarks by relative forecasting errors for all data types and horizons. Best overall results were achieved by weighted pooling with a symmetric mean absolute percentage error of 9.21% versus 11.05% obtained using the Theta method.},

Conversely, this work presents a novel neural network architecture for time-series forecasting that combines the power of graph evolution with deep recurrent learning on distinct data distributions; we named our method Recurrent Graph Evolution Neural Network (ReGENN). The idea is to infer multiple multivariate relationships between co-occurring time-series by assuming that the temporal data depends not only on inner variables and intra-temporal relationships (i.e., observations from itself) but also on outer variables and inter-temporal relationships (i.e., observations from other-selves). An extensive set of experiments was conducted comparing ReGENN with dozens of ensemble methods and classical statistical ones, showing sound improvement of up to 64.87% over the competing algorithms. Furthermore, we present an analysis of the intermediate weights arising from ReGENN, showing that by looking at inter and intra-temporal relationships simultaneously, time-series forecasting is majorly improved if paying attention to how multiple multivariate data synchronously evolve.},

These transformations are performed in two successive stages: The first stage is based on the smoothing technique for the development of a new de-noised version of the original series in which every value contains dynamic knowledge of the all previous values. The second stage of transformations is performed on the smoothed series and it is based on differencing the series in order to be stationary and be considerably easier fitted and analyzed by a deep learning model.

FTS models can handle data sets with a small number of observations or with uncertainty. This is a general advantage of FTS as compared with other techniques. However, FTS models still have some criticisms, such as the optimal lengths of intervals and the proper weights, which always influence the model accuracy and still have been of many concerns in literature. The work in this paper proposes a novel FTS forecasting model based on a new tree partitioning method (TPM) and Markov chain (MC), called FTSMC-TPM, for determining the optimal partitions of intervals and the proper weights vectors respectively, and this will greatly improve the model accuracy. The efficiency of the FTSMC-TPM model is tested using two types of time series consisting of the air pollution index (API) data, which is collected from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and the benchmark data of the University of Alabama enrollment. Three statistical criteria have been used for investigating the accuracy of the proposed model. The results indicate that the FTSMC-TPM model outperforms the existing classic and advanced time series models in terms of forecasting accuracy. In addition, the FTSMC-TPM model shows the ability to successfully deal with forecasting problems to obtain higher model accuracy, which is examined in comparison with the existing models to validate its superiority. Hence, this study demonstrates that the proposed model is more suitable for the accurate prediction of air pollution events as well as for forecasting any type of random time series.},

Quantitative prediction of rainfall time series is extremely challenging as compared to other meteorological parameters due to its variability in local features that involves temporal and spatial scales. Consequently, this requires a highly complex system having an advance model to accurately capture the highly non linear processes occurring in the climate. The focus of this work is direct prediction of multistep forecasting, where a separate time series model for each forecasting horizon is considered and forecasts are computed using observed data samples. Forecasting in this method is performed by proposing a deep learning approach, i.e, Temporal Deep Belief Network (DBN). The best model is selected from several baseline models on the basis of performance analysis metrics. The results suggest that the temporal DBN model outperforms the conventional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) specifically on rainfall time series forecasting. According to our experimentation, a modified DBN with hidden layes (300-200-100-10) performs best with 4.59E−05, 0.0068 and 0.94 values of MSE, RMSE and R value respectively on testing samples. However, we found that training DBN is more exhaustive and computationally intensive than other deep learning architectures. Findings of this research can be further utilized as basis for the advance forecasting of other weather parameters with same climate conditions.},

At present, most of the proposed methods use direct prediction based on bearing vibration signals, which not only have low prediction accuracy but also time-consuming. This paper proposes a staged prediction method, and the regularized learning machine (RELM) based on the proposed sensitive degradation feature is applied to predict RUL of the bearing with high accuracy and speed. Firstly, the relative root mean square value (RRMS) is used to divide the degradation stages of rolling bearings. Secondly, the RRMS indicator is used for multi-step time series prediction in the normal phase of the bearing. Thirdly, in the bearing's degradation stage, the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) Combined Entropy Weight Method (EWM) feature selection criterion is proposed to predict the RUL of the rolling bearing. Finally, the sensitive degradation feature of the bearing vibration signals is input into RELM to predict the RUL. The bearing data sets of PHM Challenging 2012 are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Three comparative experiments have been verified to prove the accuracy and rapidity of the proposed method in time series forecasting.},

abstract = {Accurate forecasting of passenger flow (i.e., ridership) is critical to the operation of urban metro systems. Previous studies mainly model passenger flow as time series by aggregating individual trips and then perform forecasting based on the values in the past several steps. However, this approach essentially overlooks the fact that passenger flow consists of trips from each individual traveler. For example, a traveler's work trip in the morning can help predict his/her home trip in the evening, while this causal structure cannot be explicitly encoded in standard time series models. In this paper, we propose a new forecasting framework for boarding flow by incorporating the generative mechanism into standard time series models and leveraging the strong regularity rooted in travel behavior. In doing so, we introduce returning flow from previous alighting trips as a new covariate, which captures the causal structure and long-range dependencies in passenger flow data based on travel behavior. We develop the return probability parallelogram (RPP) to summarize the causal relationships and estimate the return flow. The proposed framework is evaluated using real-world passenger flow data, and the results confirm that the returning flow—a single covariate—can substantially and consistently improve various forecasting tasks, including one-step ahead forecasting, multi-step ahead forecasting, and forecasting under special events. And the proposed method is more effective for business-type stations with most passengers come and return within the same day. This study can be extended to other modes of transport, and it also sheds new light on general demand time series forecasting problems, in which causal structure and long-range dependencies are generated by the user behavior.},

abstract = {Thanks to advances in smart metering devices (SM), the electricity sector is undergoing a series of changes, among which it is worth highlighting the ability to control the response to all events that occur in the electricity grid with the intention of making it more smart. Predicting electricity consumption data is a key factor for the energy sector in order to create a completely intelligent electricity grid that optimizes consumption and forecasts future energy needs. However, it is currently not enough to give a prediction of energy consumption (EC), but it is also necessary to give the prediction as fast as possible so that the grid can operate in the shortest possible time. An approach for developing EC prediction systems is introduced here by the use of artificial neural networks (ANN). Differently from other research studies on the subject, a divide-and-conquer strategy is used so that the target system's execution switches from one to another specialized small models that forecast the EC of a building within the time range of one hour. By simultaneously processing a large amount of data and models, a consequence of implementing them in parallel with TensorFlow on GPUs, the training procedure proposed here increases the performance of the classic time series prediction methods, which are based on ANN. Leveraging the latest generation of ANN techniques and new GPU-based architectures, correct EC predictions can be obtained and, as the experimentation carried out in this work shows, such predictions can be obtained quickly. The obtained results in this study show a promising way for speeding up big data processing of building's monitoring data to achieve energy efficiency.},

For the long-term development of the industry, many countries and enterprises began to make demand forecasts with different levels for the product market. The same is true for China's civil aircraft-related industries. There are a variety of predictive models, but not all of them are appropriate for the prediction of civil aircraft market demand. This paper introduces a variety of modelling methods for forecasting models, including time series forecasting models and causal analysis forecasting models. The contribution of our work is the adoption of a new coefficient determination method to establish a variable-weight combination forecasting model, which greatly improves the forecasting accuracy. In addition, we also propose a new and more stable prediction model, the chain prediction model. Simulation prediction is carried out for each model in this work. Through the analysis and comparison of the prediction results, we conclude that the prediction effects of the variable weight combination prediction model and the chain prediction model are superior to those of other single prediction models. The chain prediction model in particular has better performance in medium- A nd long-term prediction, compared with the other prediction models. Finally, the model is applied to predict the demand of Chinese civil aircraft in the next 20 years, which confirms that the Chinese civil aircraft market will expand in the future.},

Therefore geospatial techniques could be integrated with mathematical models for accurate spatiotemporal mapping of groundwater risk areas at the village level. In the present study, changes in water level, quality patterns, and future trends were analyzed using eight years (2012–2019) groundwater data for 171 villages of the Phagi tehsil, Jaipur district. Kriging interpolation method was used to draw spatial maps for the pre-monsoon season. These datasets were integrated with three different time series forecasting models (Simple Exponential Smoothing, Holt's Trend Method, ARIMA) and Artificial Neural Network models for accurate prediction of groundwater level and quality parameters. Results reveal that the ANN model can describe groundwater level and quality parameters more accurately than the time series forecasting models. The change in groundwater level was observed with more than 4.0 m rise in 81 villages during 2012–2013, whereas ANN predicted results of 2023–2024 predict no rise in water level > 4.0 m. However, based on predicted results of 2024, the water level will drop by more than 6.0 m in 16 villages of Phagi. Assessment of water quality index reveals unfit groundwater in 74% villages for human consumption in 2024. This time series and projected groundwater level and quality at the micro-level can assist decision-makers in sustainable groundwater management.},

abstract = {In recent years, many works spring out to adopt the forecast-based approach to support the investment decision in the financial market. Nevertheless, most of them do not consider mining the hidden patterns in the cross-regional financial time-series. However, the fluctuation in financial markets has always been affected by the global economy, instead of a single market. To overcome this issue, this article proposes an Attention enhanced Compound Neural Network (AComNN) that can be applied on features of multiple-sources, including different financial markets and economic entities. The proposed novel approach compounds of Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and self-attention to progressively capture the time-zone-dependent context behind the financial time-series across regions with multiple filters. Thereby, it provides trading signals for supporting the financial investment decision. The proposed AComNN has been applied on the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index (HSI) trend prediction based on various initial features across regions. The experimental result demonstrates that the AComNN achieves the highest average accuracy for the one-day ahead trend prediction over 60%. Besides, it reveals highly superior competitiveness on the forecasting capability improved by 13.36% on average compared with the baselines. Therefore, we encourage to adopt the proposed method to the practitioners and provide a new thought, considering the analysis of cross-regional features, in the financial time-series forecasting.},

Understanding energy market dynamics is essential to improving grid efficiency and optimizing the development of new energy conversion and storage technologies. Accurate energy price forecasts are important for many energy storage technologies to be profitable from price arbitrage. In this paper, we apply Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), a popular spatial-temporal reduced-form modeling technique, to forecast 6587 locational marginal prices in the California Day-Ahead Market (DAM). DMD is a promising equation-free modeling technique in systems with inherent periodic tendencies in time such as financial markets and fluid dynamics. Yet we show, for the first time, that DMD cannot reliably forecast day-ahead energy prices due to the periodicity of the data. Instead, we show Augmented DMD (ADMD) overcomes these limitations and is a fast and accurate price forecaster. We benchmark DMD, ADMD, and backcasting forecasting methods for optimal price arbitrage with an energy storage system. Using ADMD, a market-connected energy storage system can capture up to 92% of allowable revenues in rolling horizon simulations. Moreover, ADMD is up to 1000-times faster than time-series forecasting methods and requires orders of magnitude less data than deep/machine learning techniques.},

The structure optimization genetic algorithm for automatic construction of FCM is implemented for modeling complexity based on historical time series data, selecting the most important nodes (attributes) and interconnections among them thus providing a less complex and efficient FCM-based model. This model is used next as input in an ANN. ANNs are used at the final process for making time series prediction considering as inputs the concepts defined by the produced FCM. The previously proposed structure optimization genetic algorithm for FCM construction by historical data as well as the ANN have been already proved their efficacy on time series forecasting. The performance of the proposed approach is presented through the analysis of multivariate historical data of benchmark datasets for making predictions. The multivariate analysis of historical data is held for a large number of input variables, like season, month, day or week, holiday, mean and high temperature, etc. The whole approach was implemented in an intelligent software tool initially deployed for FCM prediction.

abstract = {It is believed that anomalous mental states such as stress and anxiety not only cause suffering for the individuals, but also lead to tragedies in some extreme cases. The ability to predict the mental state of an individual at both current and future time periods could prove critical to healthcare practitioners. Currently, the practical way to predict an individual's mental state is through mental examinations that involve psychological experts performing the evaluations. However, such methods can be time and resource consuming, mitigating their broad applicability to a wide population. Furthermore, some individuals may also be unaware of their mental states or may feel uncomfortable to express themselves during the evaluations. Hence, their anomalous mental states could remain undetected for a prolonged period of time. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the ability of using advanced machine learning based approaches to generate mathematical models that predict current and future mental states of an individual. The problem of mental state prediction is transformed into the time series forecasting problem, where an individual is represented as a multivariate time series stream of monitored physical and behavioral attributes. A personalized mathematical model is then automatically generated to capture the dependencies among these attributes, which is used for prediction of mental states for each individual. In particular, we first illustrate the drawbacks of traditional multivariate time series forecasting methodologies such as vector autoregression. Then, we show that such issues could be mitigated by using machine learning regression techniques which are modified for capturing temporal dependencies in time series data. A case study using the data from 150 human participants illustrates that the proposed machine learning based forecasting methods are more suitable for high-dimensional psychological data than the traditional vector autoregressive model in terms of both magnitude of error and directional accuracy. These results not only present a successful usage of machine learning techniques in psychological studies, but also serve as a building block for multiple medical applications that could rely on an automated system to gauge individuals' mental states.},

By using images which have been created from the sequenced values of multivariate time series, the proposed CNN model could determine and extract related important parameters, in an implicit and automatic way, without any need for human interaction and expert knowledge, and all by itself. By following this strategy, it was shown how employing the proposed method is easier than some traditional STLF models. Therefore it could be seen as one of the big difference between the proposed method and some state-of-the-art methodologies of STLF. Moreover, using fuzzy logic had great contribution to control over-fitting by expressing one dimension of time series by a fuzzy space, in a spectrum, and a shadow instead of presenting it with exact numbers.

While many variations of attention have been developed over recent years, all share a common component in the application of a softmax function to normalize the attention weights, in order to transform them into valid mixing coefficients. In this paper, we aim to improve the modeling flexibility of a generic attention module by innovatively replacing this softmax operation with a learnable softmax, in which the normalizing functions are also adapted from the data. Specifically, our generalized softmax builds upon recent work in learning activation functions for deep networks, in particular the kernel activation function and its extensions. We describe the application of the proposed technique for the challenging case of time series forecasting with the dual-stage attention-based recurrent neural network (DA-RNN), an innovative model for predicting time series that employs two different attention modules for handling exogenous factors and long-term dependencies. A series of real-world benchmarks are used to show that simply plugging-in our generalized attention model can improve results on all datasets, even when keeping the number of trainable parameters in the model constant. To further evaluate the algorithm, we collect a novel dataset for predicting the Bitcoin closing exchange rate, a problem of high practical significance lately. Finally, to foster research in the topic, we also release both the dataset and our model as an open source extensible library. Over a baseline DA-RNN, our proposed model delivers an improvement of MAR ranging from 6% to 15% using our newly-released dataset.},

Still, as spatiotemporal sequences that arise in the real world are noisy and chaotic, modeling approaches that utilize probabilistic temporal models, such as deep Markov models (DMMs), are favorable because of their ability to model uncertainty, increasing their robustness to noise. However, approaches based on DMMs do not maintain the spatial characteristics of spatiotemporal sequences, with most of the approaches converting the observed input into 1D data halfway through the model. To solve this, we propose a model that retains the spatial aspect of the target sequence with a DMM that consists of 2D convolutional neural networks. We then show the robustness of our method to data with large variance compared with naive forecast, vanilla DMM, and convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) using synthetic data, even outperforming the DNN models over a longer forecast period. We also point out the limitations of our model when forecasting real-world precipitation data and the possible future work that can be done to address these limitations, along with additional future research potential.},

As the volume of historical data increases, powerful forecasting techniques that reveal unknown relationships between past and future values are required to provide accurate forecasts of production and sales. Thus, in this paper, a composite GRU-Prophet model with an attention mechanism was constructed to predict sales volume. In this composite model, Prophet model and GRU model with attention mechanism were used to capture linear and nonlinear features, respectively. The composite model was experimentally determined to be more applicable and to provide more accurate predictions than did recurrent neural network, long short-term memory, gate recurrent unit, Prophet, and autoregressive integrated moving average models. This study's composite model is suited to rapid changes in market demand and helps enterprises be more competitive in the field of smart manufacturing.},

Short-term forecasting covers a range of predictions from a fraction of an hour-ahead to a day-ahead forecasting. An accurate load forecast results in establishing appropriate operational practices and bidding strategies, as well as scheduling adequate energy transactions. This paper presents a generalized technique for modeling historical load data in the form of time-series with different cycles of seasonality (e.g., daily, weekly, quarterly, annually) in a given power network. The proposed method separately models both non-seasonal and seasonal cycles of the load data using auto-regressive (AR) and moving-average (MA) components, which only rely on historical load data without requiring any additional inputs such as historical weather data (which might not be available in most cases). The accuracy of data modeling is examined using the Akaike/Bayesian information criteria (AIC/BIC) which are two effective quantification methods for evaluation of data forecasting. In order to validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed forecaster, we use the hourly-metered load data of PJM network as a real-world input dataset.},

ANN is a kind of machine learning method utilized widely for streamflow time series, and which performs well in forecasting nonstationary time series without the need of physical analysis for complex and dynamic hydrological processes. Most studies take multiple factors determining the streamflow as inputs such as rainfall. In this study, a long-term streamflow forecasting model depending only on the historical streamflow data is proposed. Various preprocessing techniques, including empirical mode decomposition (EMD), ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT), are first used to decompose the streamflow time series into simple components with different timescale characteristics, and the relation between these components and the original streamflow at the next time step is analyzed by ANN. Hybrid models EMD-ANN, EEMD-ANN and DWT-ANN are developed in this study for long-term daily streamflow forecasting, and performance measures root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) indicate that the proposed EEMD-ANN method performs better than EMD-ANN and DWT-ANN models, especially in high flow forecasting.},

However, no real-life application of soil gas monitoring has been developed until now. We present a new monitoring approach that is based on a continuous comparison of actual soil CO  concentration data against predicted target values including estimated confidence intervals which are considered as threshold values. Our new approach is based on time series forecasting methods. Since they are not commonplace in soil gas monitoring we give an introduction to simple approaches and more sophisticated modelling categories. These have been tested on different data sets from our soil gas monitoring data base. Finally, we apply the most robust overall model to real time monitoring data of the Hontom{\'{i}}n carbon sequestration pilot site. The evaluation revealed that Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models give reliable estimates of future soil gas concentrations. On a practice-relevant time frame, the accuracy of predicted values and confidence intervals is better than compared to simple approaches like seasonal means. As a result, we present a practical, methodological approach that increases the technology readiness level of soil gas monitoring. Moreover, it has a high potential to be transferred to other environmental monitoring compartments (e.g. soil gas emissions). Since the applied workflow can be automated, integration in real time monitoring systems is straightforward. However, a minimum of two years of data is required to achieve an adequate forecasting precision. 2 2},

All these components of the error allow to determinate a global uncertainty generating prediction bands related to the prediction efficiency. We also have defined a reliability index which could be very interesting for the grid manager in order to estimate the validity of predictions. We have experimented this method on a multilayer perceptron which is a popular machine learning technique.

SSA depends on two main choices: the window length L and the number of eigentriples used for grouping r. One of the most important issues when analyzing time series is the forecast of new observations. When using SSA for time series forecasting there are several alternative algorithms, the most widely used being the recurrent forecasting model, which assumes that a given observation can be written as a linear combination of the L−1 previous observations. However, when the window length L is large, the forecasting model is unlikely to be parsimonious. In this paper we propose a new parsimonious recurrent forecasting model that uses an optimal m(<L−1) coefficients in the linear combination of the recurrent SSA. Our results support the idea of using this new parsimonious recurrent forecasting model instead of the standard recurrent SSA forecasting model.},

Because of the complexity and nonlinearity of the time series of container throughputs at ports, the methodology decomposes the original time series into several components, which are rather simpler sub-sequences. Consequently, difficult forecasting tasks are simplified into a number of relatively easier subtasks. In this way, the proposed hybrid models can improve the accuracy of forecasting significantly. In the methodology, four main steps are involved: data decomposition, component reconstruction based on the DCA, individual prediction for each reconstructed component, and ensemble prediction as the final output. An empirical analysis was conducted for illustration and verification purposes by using time series of container throughputs at three main ports in Bohai Rim, China. The results suggest that the proposed hybrid models are able to forecast better than do other benchmark models. Forecasting may facilitate effective real-time decision making for strategic management and policy drafting. Predictions of container throughput can help port managers make tactical and operational decisions, such as operations planning in ports, the scheduling of port equipment, and route optimization.},

To effectively analyses and forecast the natural rubber's price and volatility, this paper constructed a hybrid model that integrated the bidirectional gated recurrent unit and variational mode decomposition for short-term prediction of the natural rubber futures on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. In data preprocessing period, time series is decomposed by variational mode decomposition to capture the tendency and mutability information. The bidirectional gated recurrent unit is introduced to return the one-day-ahead prediction of the closing price and 7-day volatility for the natural rubber futures. The experimental results demonstrated that: (a) variational mode decomposition is an effective method for time series analysis, which can capture the information closely related to the market fluctuations; (b) the bidirectional neural network structure can significantly improve the model performance both in terms of fitting performance and the trend prediction; (c) a correspondence was found between the predicted target, i.e., the price and volatility, and the intrinsic modes, which manifested as the impact of the long-term and short-term characteristics on the targets at different time-scales.

In order to attain the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for MMR in India, the purpose of this research work is to identify the trends in the essential components, which are responsible for maternal death prevention. Methods: To achieve the above-mentioned objective we have evaluated the performance of three different approaches in our process model for Time Series Predictive Modelling on public maternal health data. The first approach is Exponential Smoothing method i.e. is a statistics based method, the second one is Multi Layer Perceptron method i.e. a machine learning based method and the third one is Long Short Term Memory network i.e. a deep learning method.

It is partitioned into training data for modeling and testing data for validation of the model. Results: The major components from the original data are selected by using an attribute selection method i.e. greedy approach based Best-First Wrapper method. The MAPE statistical parameter is used to define the accuracy level of the predictive values for the selected dimensions of the given data. A performance-based comparison of all applied approaches is presented at last which illustrates that exponential smoothing method has performed better than the other two methods.

In this context, the development of systems for monitoring, forecasting, and controlling emissions plays an important role. The literature about forecasting systems based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) ensembles has been highlighted regarding statistical accuracy and efficiency. In this article, trainable and non-trainable combination methods are used for PM10 and PM2.5 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 and 2.5 micrometers, respectively) time series forecasting for eight different locations, in Finland and Brazil, for different periods. Trainable ensembles based on ANNs, linear regression, and Copulas are compared with non-trainable combinations (mean and median), single ANNs, and linear statistical approaches. Different models are considered so far, including Autoregressive model (AR), Autoregressive and Moving Average Model (ARMA), Infinite Impulse Response Filters (IIR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function Networks (RBF), Extreme Learning Machines (ELM), Echo State Networks (ESN), and Adaptive Network Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). The use of ANNs ensembles, mainly combined with MLP, leads to a better one step ahead forecasting performance. The use of robust air pollution forecasting tools is prime to assist governments in managing air pollution issues like hospital collapse during adverse air quality situations.

The application of standard SOM, and its variants, to time series prediction has been studied in the literature under different conditions and techniques. In this paper, we have focused on the standard Self-Organizing Maps, and its application for time series forecasting. We provide extensive numerical analysis considering regular and complex topologies, and real time series. Concretely, we study the impact of the number of neurons, the effect of the best-matching unit over its neighborhood, the use of nonlinear learning rate functions, and the importance of a proportional training together with a sampled input space as uniformly as possible. We have found that probabilistic updating in neighborhoods may be used as a second learning rate parameter within the SOM. We have also found that small-world and scale-free topologies are able to improve the error of regular lattices, depending on their own set of parameters, the number of neurons, and the length of the training set. Finally, we have found coherence between results of real time series and analytic benchmarks for forecasting.},

Predicting for shorter intervals requires lower execution time combined with higher accuracy. To deal with this issue, an ensemble model is proposed with the fixed-batch-training method. To excel in the execution time, a fixed-batch-training method is used. On the other hand, the ensemble of multiple machine learning algorithms provides higher accuracy. The experimental result shows that this predictive model can produce at least 10% higher accuracy in comparison with the other available widely used short-term time series forecasting models. In the studied medical system, this gain in accuracy for the earlier prediction of workload can reduce the Medicare relative value unit cost by $1.1 million annually, which we have formulated and shown in this paper.

abstract = {This paper introduces a novel algorithm for big data time series forecasting. Its main novelty lies in its ability to deal with multivariate data, i.e. to consider multiple time series simultaneously, in order to make multi-output predictions. Real-world processes are typically characterised by several interrelated variables, and the future occurrence of certain time series cannot be explained without understanding the influence that other time series might have on the target time series. One key issue in the context of the multivariate analysis is to determine a priori whether exogenous variables must be included in the model or not. To deal with this, a correlation analysis is used to find a minimum correlation threshold that an exogenous time series must exhibit, in order to be beneficial. Furthermore, the proposed approach has been specifically designed to be used in the context of big data, thus making it possible to efficiently process very large time series. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach we use data from Spanish electricity prices. Results have been compared to other multivariate approaches showing remarkable improvements both in terms of accuracy and execution time.},

abstract = {Multivariate time series prediction, with a profound impact on human social life, has been attracting growing interest in machine learning research. However, the task of time series forecasting is very challenging because it is affected by many complex factors. For example, in predicting traffic and solar power generation, weather can bring great trouble. In particular, for strictly periodic time series, if the periodic information can be extracted from the historical sequence data to the maximum, the accuracy of the prediction will be greatly improved. At present, for time series prediction tasks, the sequence models based on RNN have made great progress. However, the sequence models has difficulty in capturing global information, failing to well highlight the periodic characteristics of the time series. But the this problem can be solved by CNN models. So in this paper, we propose a model called Multiple CNNs to solve the problem of periodic multivariate time series prediction. The working process of Multiple CNNs is analyzing the periodicity of time series, extracting the closeness and the long and short periodic information of the predicted target respectively, and finally integrating the characteristics of the three parts to make the prediction. Moreover, the model is highly flexible, which allows users to freely adjust the cycle span set in the model according to their own data characteristics. Tests on two large real-world datasets, show that our model has a strong advantage over other time series prediction methods.},

However, how to more accurately forecast time series with good efficiency is still an open question. To address this issue, we propose an efficient time series forecasting method based on the DC algorithm and visibility relations on the vertexes set. Firstly, the time series is mapped into the network by the DC algorithm, which is a more efficient approach to generate the visibility graph. Then, we use the variation trends (slope) of those nodes that have visibility relation with the last node to get the preliminary predictive values. Afterward, the value of the last node is adopted to obtain the revised predictive values, which are assigned different weights according to node degree and time distance to get the final weighted result. To better demonstrate the prediction performance and applicability of the proposed method, the proposed method is applied to different time series data sets. The empirical results show that the proposed method could provide a higher level of forecasting accuracy than many methods with relatively lower time complexity.},

A set of deep belief networks (DBNs) is used to build the state-dependent functional coefficients of the SD-AR model, and the proposed model is called DBN-AR model, which combines the advantage of DBN in function approximation and the merit of SD-AR model in nonlinear dynamics description. The DBN-AR model is driven by the state signal changing with time. Based on the least squares solution with minimum norm and the pseudo inverse matrix approach, the initial target values of the DBNs are determined in pre-training stage. In fine tuning stage, all parameters of DBN-AR model is finally tuned by the back propagation (BP) algorithm designed for fine-tuning of DBN-AR model.

abstract = {Time-series analysis and forecasting is generally considered as one of the most challenging problems in data mining. During the last decade, powerful deep learning methodologies have been efficiently applied for time-series forecasting; however, they cannot guarantee the development of reliable prediction models. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for supporting deep learning in enhancing accurate, efficient and reliable time-series models. The major novelty of our proposed methodology is that it ensures a time-series to be “suitable” for fitting a deep learning model by performing a series of transformations in order to satisfy the stationarity property. The enforcement of stationarity is performed by the application of Augmented Dickey–Fuller test and transformations based on first differences or returns, without the loss of any embedded information. The reliability of the deep learning model's predictions is guaranteed by rejecting the hypothesis of autocorrelation in the model's errors, which is demonstrated by autocorrelation function plots and Ljung–Box Q test. Our numerical experiments were performed utilizing time-series from three real-world application domains (financial market, energy sector, cryptocurrency area), which incorporate most of global research interest. The performance of all forecasting models was compared on both problems of forecasting time-series price (regression) and time-series directional movements (classification). Additionally, the reliability of the models' forecasts was evaluated by examining the existence of autocorrelation in the errors. Our numerical experiments indicate that our proposed methodology considerably improves the forecasting performance of a deep learning model, in terms of efficiency, accuracy and reliability.},

In this way, models to properly predict variations in the price of products and services could be one of the keys to the success in agribusiness. Consistent models are being adopted by companies as part of a decision making process when important choices are based on short or long-term forecasting. This work aims to evaluate Wavelet Neural Networks (WNNs) performance combined with five optimization techniques in order to obtain the best time series forecasting by considering two case studies in the agribusiness sector. The first one adopts the soybean sack price and the second deals with the demand problem of a distinct groups of products from a food company, where nonlinear trends are the main characteristic on both time series. The optimization techniques adopted in this work are: Differential Evolution, Artificial Bee Colony, Glowworm Swarm Optimization, Gravitational Search Algorithm, and Imperialist Competitive Algorithm. Those were evaluated by considering short-term and long-term forecasting, and a prediction horizon of 30 days ahead was considered for the soybean sack price case, while 12 months ahead was selected for the products demand case. The performance of the optimization techniques in training the WNN were compared to the well-established Backpropagation algorithm and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) assuming accuracy measures. In long-term forecasting, which is considered more difficult than the short-term case due to the error accumulation, the best combinations in terms of precision was reached by distinct methods according to each case, showing the importance of testing different training strategies. This work also showed that the prediction horizon significantly affected the performance of each optimization method in different ways, and the potential of assuming optimization in WNN learning process.},

A recursive, AutoRegressive time series model using eXogenous inputs (ARX) and a rolling forecasting origin has been developed to provide reliable short-term forecasts of the internal temperatures in dwellings during hot summer conditions, especially heatwaves. The model was tested using monitored data from three case study dwellings recorded during the 2015 heatwave. The predictor variables were selected by minimising the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), in order to automatically identify a near-optimal model. The model proved capable of performing multi-step-ahead predictions during extreme heat events with an acceptable accuracy for periods up to 72 h, with hourly results achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) below 0.7 °C for every forecast. Comparison between ARX and AutoRegressive Moving Average models with eXogenous inputs (ARMAX) models showed that the ARX models provided consistently more reliable multi-step-ahead predictions. Prediction intervals, at the 95% probability level, were adopted to define a credible interval for the forecast temperatures at different prediction horizons. The results point to the potential for using time series forecasting as part of an overheating early-warning system in buildings housing vulnerable occupants or contents.},

abstract = {This work presents a hybrid and hierarchical deep learning model for midterm load forecasting. The model combines exponential smoothing (ETS), advanced long short-term memory (LSTM), and ensembling. ETS extracts dynamically the main components of each individual time series and enables the model to learn their representation. Multilayer LSTM is equipped with dilated recurrent skip connections and a spatial shortcut path from lower layers to allow the model to better capture long-term seasonal relationships and ensure more efficient training. A common learning procedure for LSTM and ETS, with a penalized pinball loss, leads to simultaneous optimization of data representation and forecasting performance. In addition, ensembling at three levels ensures a powerful regularization. A simulation study performed on the monthly electricity demand time series for 35 European countries confirmed the high performance of the proposed model and its competitiveness with classical models such as ARIMA and ETS as well as state-of-the-art models based on machine learning.},

abstract = {Electricity price forecasting plays a vital role in the financial markets. This paper proposes a self-adaptive, decomposed, heterogeneous, and ensemble learning model for short-term electricity price forecasting one, two, and three-months-ahead in the Brazilian market. Exogenous variables, such as supply, lagged prices and demand are considered as inputs signals of the forecasting model. Firstly, the coyote optimization algorithm is adopted to tune the hyperparameters of complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition in the pre-processing phase. Next, three machine learning models, including extreme learning machine, gradient boosting machine, and support vector regression models, as well as Gaussian process, are designed with the intent of handling the components obtained through the signal decomposition approach with focus on time series forecasting. The individual forecasting models are directly integrated in order to obtain the final forecasting prices one to three-months-ahead. In this case, a grid of forecasting models is obtained. The best forecasting model is the one that has better generalization out-of-sample. The empirical results show the efficiency of the proposed model. Additionally, it can achieve forecasting errors lower than 4.2% in terms of symmetric mean absolute percentage error. The ranking of importance of the variables, from the smallest to the largest is, lagged prices, demand, and supply. This paper provided useful insights for multi-step-ahead forecasting in the electrical market, once the proposed model can enhance forecasting accuracy and stability.},

The Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) architecture provides a greener alternative with low energy consumption for mining big data, bringing the power of thousands of processing cores into a single chip, thus opening a wide range of possible applications. In this paper (a substantial extension of the short version presented at REM2016 on April 19–21, Maldives [1]), we design a novel parallel strategy for time series learning, in which different parts of the time series are evaluated by different threads. The proposed strategy is inserted inside the core a hybrid metaheuristic model, applied for learning patterns from an important mini/microgrid forecasting problem, the household electricity demand forecasting. The future smart cities will surely rely on distributed energy generation, in which citizens should be aware about how to manage and control their own resources. In this sense, energy disaggregation research will be part of several typical and useful microgrid applications.

abstract = {Dengue and influenza-like illness (ILI) are two of the leading causes of viral infection in the world and it is estimated that more than half the world's population is at risk for developing these infections. It is therefore important to develop accurate methods for forecasting dengue and ILI incidences. Since data from multiple sources (such as dengue and ILI case counts, electronic health records and frequency of multiple internet search terms from Google Trends) can improve forecasts, standard time series analysis methods are inadequate to estimate all the parameter values from the limited amount of data available if we use multiple sources. In this paper, we use a computationally efficient implementation of the known variable selection method that we call the Autoregressive Likelihood Ratio (ARLR) method. This method combines sparse representation of time series data, electronic health records data (for ILI) and Google Trends data to forecast dengue and ILI incidences. This sparse representation method uses an algorithm that maximizes an appropriate likelihood ratio at every step. Using numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method recovers the underlying sparse model much more accurately than the lasso method. We apply our method to dengue case count data from five countries/states: Brazil, Mexico, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand and to ILI case count data from the United States. Numerical experiments show that our method outperforms existing time series forecasting methods in forecasting the dengue and ILI case counts. In particular, our method gives a 18 percent forecast error reduction over a leading method that also uses data from multiple sources. It also performs better than other methods in predicting the peak value of the case count and the peak time.},

However, long-term forecasting is difficult, particularly for cases where the underlying models and parameters are complex and unknown. Neural networks can effectively process features in temporal units and are attractive for such purposes. Reservoir computing, in particular, can offer efficient temporal processing of recurrent neural networks with a low training cost, and is thus well suited to time-series analysis and forecasting tasks. Here, we report a reservoir computing hardware system based on dynamic tungsten oxide (WO ) memristors that can efficiently process temporal data. The internal short-term memory effects of the WO  memristors allow the memristor-based reservoir to nonlinearly map temporal inputs into reservoir states, where the projected features can be readily processed by a linear readout function. We use the system to experimentally demonstrate two standard benchmarking tasks: isolated spoken-digit recognition with partial inputs, and chaotic system forecasting. A high classification accuracy of 99.2% is obtained for spoken-digit recognition, and autonomous chaotic time-series forecasting has been demonstrated over the long term. x x},

Multicast is increasingly being used to carry uncompressed video in media data centers with very large bandwidth requirements per flow. Multicast control protocols such as IGMP and PIM build multicast trees without trying to maximize the overall fabric capacity, leading to decreased fabric utilization and inability to service flows. In addition, existing multicast protocols are not bandwidth-aware and could cause links to over-subscribe leading to packet loss and negative user quality of experience. In this paper, we formulate offline optimization for multicast trees in clos fabric. We then design and implement two novel algorithms, iRP and LiRP, to optimize multicast tree formation and increase overall fabric multicast capacity. iRP algorithm optimizes online formation of multicast trees while addressing bandwidth requirements using SDN controller. We share analysis of TV studio repetitive traffic patterns the benefits of time series forecasting to predict multicast group membership and bring online optimization efficiency closer to offline optimization results. We then implement and test LiRP algorithm to increases iRP's fabric efficiency by implementing k-fold cross validation method to predict future multicast group memberships leading to optimized multicast tree placement. We implement iRP and LiRP algorithms using controller-based system and test both algorithms using Cisco Nexus commercially available switches. Testing results confirm that iRP Algorithm increases fabric capacity by 60% compared to PIM performance. LiRP system increases the efficiency of iRP by up to 40% through prediction of multicast group memberships with online arrival.},

It is not a trivial task, as there are various short-term and/or long-term temporal dependencies. Multiscale modeling has been considered as a promising strategy to solve this problem. However, the existing multiscale models either apply an implicit way to model the temporal dependencies or ignore the interrelationships between multiscale subseries. In this article, we propose a multiscale interactive recurrent network (MiRNN) to jointly capture multiscale patterns. MiRNN employs a deep wavelet decomposition network to decompose the raw time series into multiscale subseries. MiRNN introduces three key strategies (truncation, initialization, and message passing) to model the inherent interrelationships between multiscale subseries, as well as a dual-stage attention mechanism to capture multiscale temporal dependencies. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our model achieves promising performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

Conventionally, customer segmentation approaches are utilized when dealing with a large population of customers. Inspired by this idea, a new methodology is proposed in this study to perform segment-level customer behavior forecasting. To keep the dynamic nature of customer behavior, customer behavior is represented as a time series. Therefore, customer behavior forecasting is changed into a time series forecasting problem. The proposed methodology contains two main components i.e. clustering and forecasting. In the clustering phase, time series are clustered using time series clustering algorithms, and then, in the forecasting phase, the behavior of each segment is predicted via time series forecasting techniques. The main objective is to predict future behavior at segment level. The forecasting component also consists of a combined method exploiting the concept of forecast fusion. The combined method employs a pool of forecasters both from traditional time series forecasting and computational intelligence methods. To test the usefulness of the proposed method, a case study is carried out using the data of customers' point of sale (POS) in a bank. The results of the experiments demonstrate that the combined method outperforms all other individual forecasters in terms of symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE).

Among the available techniques, those based on machine learning models have sparked the interest of the scientific community in recent decades due to their good adaptability and forecasting accuracy, particularly when coupled with data pretreatment methods. These algorithms include artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVMs). In the present study, a comparative analysis of a set of machine learning models, namely, an ANN and an SVM coupled with wavelet transform and data resampling with the bootstrap method, was performed. The analysis of these models was performed with daily streamflow time series for Sobradinho Reservoir, which is located in northeastern Brazil, corresponding to the period between 1931 and 2015. The results show that higher accuracy is achieved by the ANN than by the SVM. Furthermore, the best combination for predicting the streamflow into the Sobradinho Reservoir was the bootstrap, wavelet and neural network (BWNN) method. For a forecast 3 to 15 days ahead, this method yielded a mean square error (MSE) 15 to 25 times lower than that of the purely neural model (ANN), and the R  and mean absolute error (MAE) coefficients increased by more than 7 to 28% and 13 to 50%, respectively. Therefore, the BWNN is an alternative approach for future time series forecasting studies. 2},

When properly addressed the cloud workload forecasting problem becomes a really interesting case study. As there is no general methodology in the literature that addresses this problem analytically and from a time series forecasting perspective (even less so in the cloud field), we propose a combination of these tools based on a state-of-the-art forecasting methodology which we have enhanced with some elements, such as: a specific cost function, statistical tests, visual analysis, etc. The insights obtained from this analysis are used to detect the asymmetrical nature of the forecasting problem and to find the best forecasting model from the viewpoint of the current state of the art in time series forecasting. From an operational point of view the most interesting forecast is a short-time horizon, so we focus on this. To show the feasibility of this methodology, we apply it to several realistic workload datasets from different datacenters.

Moreover, on the analyzed datasets, the penalty cost as usually included in the SLA can be reduced to a 30 percent on average.},

This is a step toward making informed/explainable decisions in the domain of time series, powered by deep learning. There have been numerous efforts to increase the interpretability of image-centric deep neural network models, where the learned features are more intuitive to visualize. Visualization in the domain of time series is significantly challenging, as there is no direct interpretation of the filters and inputs compared with the imaging modality. In addition, a little or no concentration has been devoted to the development of such tools in the domain of time series in the past. TSViz provides possibilities to explore and analyze the network from different dimensions at different levels of abstraction, which includes the identification of the parts of the input that were responsible for a particular prediction (including per filter saliency), importance of the different filters present in the network, notion of diversity present in the network through filter clustering, understanding of the main sources of variation learned by the network through inverse optimization, and analysis of the network's robustness against adversarial noise. As a sanity check for the computed influence values, we demonstrate our results on pruning of neural networks based on the computed influence information. These representations allow the user to better understand the network so that the acceptability of these deep models for time-series analysis can be enhanced. This is extremely important in domains, such as finance, industry 4.0, self-driving cars, health care, and counter-terrorism, where reasons for reaching a particular prediction are equally important as the prediction itself.

Firstly, a spatial-temporal modeling is used for historical traffic data extracting. After that, causality analysis is applied to communication data analysis for the first time. Based on causal analysis, multivariate long short-term memory models are used to predict future data for CDR data. Finally, the prediction algorithm is used to process real data of different scenes in the city to verify the performance of the entire system.},

abstract = {Generating forecasts for time series with multiple seasonal cycles is an important use case for many industries nowadays. Accounting for the multiseasonal patterns becomes necessary to generate more accurate and meaningful forecasts in these contexts. In this article, we propose long short-term memory multiseasonal net (LSTM-MSNet), a decomposition-based unified prediction framework to forecast time series with multiple seasonal patterns. The current state of the art in this space is typically univariate methods, in which the model parameters of each time series are estimated independently. Consequently, these models are unable to include key patterns and structures that may be shared by a collection of time series. In contrast, LSTM-MSNet is a globally trained LSTM network, where a single prediction model is built across all the available time series to exploit the cross-series knowledge in a group of related time series. Furthermore, our methodology combines a series of state-of-the-art multiseasonal decomposition techniques to supplement the LSTM learning procedure. In our experiments, we are able to show that on data sets from disparate data sources, e.g., the popular M4 forecasting competition, a decomposition step is beneficial, whereas, in the common real-world situation of homogeneous series from a single application, exogenous seasonal variables or no seasonal preprocessing at all are better choices. All options are readily included in the framework and allow us to achieve competitive results for both cases, outperforming many state-of-the-art multiseasonal forecasting methods.},

The transport literature is also sparse when it comes to city-scale traffic predictions, mainly because of low data availability. In this work, we report an effort to investigate whether deep learning models can be useful for the long-term large-scale traffic prediction task, while focusing on the scalability of the models. We investigate a city-scale traffic dataset with 14 weeks of speed observations collected every 15 minutes over 1098 segments in the hypercenter of Los Angeles, California. We look at a variety of state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning predictors for link-based predictions, and investigate how such predictors can scale up to larger areas with clustering, and graph convolutional approaches. We discuss that modelling temporal and spatial features into deep learning predictors can be helpful for long-term predictions, while simpler, not deep learning-based predictors, achieve very satisfactory performance for link-based and short-term forecasting. The trade-off is discussed not only in terms of prediction accuracy vs prediction horizon but also in terms of training time and model sizing.},

abstract = {Time series forecasting is one of the most important issues in numerous applications in real life. The objective of this study was to propose a hybrid neural network model based on wavelet transform (WT) and feature extraction for time series forecasting. The motivation of the proposed model, which is called PCA-WCCNN, is to establish a single simplified model with shorter training time and satisfactory forecasting performance. This model combines the principal component analysis (PCA) and WT with artificial neural networks (ANNs). Given a forecasting sequence, order of the original forecasting model is determined firstly. Secondly, the original time series is decomposed into approximation and detail components by employing WT technique. Then, instead of using all the components as inputs, feature inputs are extracted from all the sub-series obtained from the above step. Finally, based on the extracted features and all the sub-series, a famous neural network construction method called cascade-correlation algorithm is applied to train neural network model to learn the dynamics. As an illustration, the proposed model is compared with two classical models and two hybrid models, respectively. They are the traditional cascade-correlation neural network, back-propagation neural network, wavelet-based cascade-correlation network using all the wavelet components as inputs to establish one model (WCCNN) and wavelet-based cascade-correlation network with combination of each sub-series model (WCCNN multi-models). Results obtained from this study indicate that the proposed method improves the accuracy of ANN and can yield better efficiency than other four neural network models.},

Many robotic systems, such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), are required to operate in environments with disturbances and relative motion that make task performance difficult. This motion often exhibits periodic, near-sinusoidal behaviour. By predicting this motion, control strategies can be developed to improve accuracy. Moreover, factoring in uncertainty can aid the robustness of these predictive control methods. Time series and Fourier series have been applied to several predictive control problems in a variety of fields. However, there are contradictory results in performance based on parameters, assessment criteria, and application. This paper seeks to clarify these discrepancies using AUV motion as a case study. GPR is also introduced as a third candidate for prediction based on previous applications to time series forecasting in other fields of science. In addition to assessing mean prediction accuracy, the ability of each model to adequately bound prediction error is also considered as a key performance indicator.},

This study aims at developing advanced SPM and AD for financial data by cutting edge techniques from artificial intelligence and machine learning. The nonlinearity and non-stationarity of financial time series dynamics pose a major challenge for SPM and AD. This study employs time–frequency analysis to extract features for SPM. Then, a sparse multi-manifold clustering (SMMC) is used to partition the feature space into several disjointed regions for better AD. Finally, local relevance vector machines (RVMs) are employed for AD and perform the forecasting. Different from traditional methods, the novel forecasting system operates on multiple resolutions and multiple dynamic regimes. SMMC finds both the neighbors and the weights automatically by a sparse solution, which approximately spans a low-dimensional affine subspace at that point. RVM, the Bayesian kernel machines, can produce parsimonious models with excellent generalization properties. Taking multiple time series data from financial markets as an example, the empirical results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms traditional models and significantly reduces the forecasting errors.

abstract = {Variations in the price of asphalt cement have become a serious challenge for Departments of Transportation in proper budgeting of transportation projects. This issue has also pressed contractors in their efforts to develop appropriate cost estimates for transportation projects. Although the price of asphalt cement increases over the long term, it is subject to significant short-term variations. In the current state of practice, the following approaches have been utilized to predict the future price of asphalt cement: (1) adding a fixed percentage of the estimated total cost of asphalt cement to escalate the price of asphalt cement (i.e., adding a risk premium); (2) inflating the estimated cost of asphalt cement to the expected midpoint of construction period to estimate the total cost of asphalt cement; and (3) conducting Monte Carlo simulation analysis to characterize uncertainty about future price of asphalt cement. None of these methods consider autocorrelation in the historical records of asphalt cement price. This paper departs from the existing body of knowledge and challenges the lack of proper treatment of short-term variations in predicting asphalt cement price. The research objectives of this paper are to: (1) identify and characterize variations observed in actual prices of asphalt cement over time; and (2) utilize this knowledge to create time-series forecasting models for asphalt cement price and examine whether and how time-series forecasting models can predict future prices of asphalt cement with higher accuracy compared to the existing approaches. Based on the identified time series characteristics, four univariate time series forecasting models, namely Holt Exponential Smoothing (ES), Holt-Winters ES, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and seasonal ARIMA, are created to take into account the short-term variation of asphalt cement price in forecasting its future values. The forecasting results show that all four time series models can predict future prices of asphalt cement with higher accuracy than the existing methods, such as Monte Carlo simulation. Among the four models, the ARIMA and Holt ES models are the most accurate forecasting models with errors less than 2%. This study can help both owners and contractors improve budgeting process, prepare more-accurate cost estimates, and reduce the risk of asphalt cement price variations in transportation projects.},

First, a predictive model generates an initial forecasting for a time series. Second, a residual time series is calculated as the difference between the original time series and the initial forecasting. If that residual series is not white noise, then it can be used to improve the accuracy of the initial model and a new predictive model is adjusted using residual series. The whole process is repeated until convergence or the residual series becomes white noise. The output of the method is then given by summing up the outputs of all trained predictive models in a perturbative sense. To test the method, an experimental investigation was conducted on six real world time series. A comparison was made with six other methods experimented and ten other results found in the literature. Results show that not only the performance of the initial model is significantly improved but also the proposed method outperforms the other results previously published.},

The iFIS antecedents identification uses a fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm for interval-valued data with adaptive distances, whereas parameters of the linear consequents are estimated with a center-range methodology to fit a linear regression model to symbolic interval data. iFIS forecasting power, measured by accuracy metrics and statistical tests, was evaluated through Monte Carlo experiments using both synthetic interval-valued time series with linear and chaotic dynamics, and real financial interval-valued time series. The results indicate a superior performance of iFIS compared to traditional alternative single-valued and interval-valued forecasting models by reducing 19% on average the predicting errors, indicating that the suggested approach can be considered as a promising tool for interval time series forecasting.},

Effective water resource management requires the identification of the most susceptible regions and periods to such risks and, hence, spatio-temporal prediction tools of groundwater levels. For this purpose, we use 27 years of groundwater level records (between 1984 and 2012) and apply time series forecasting models including seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (HWES). The spatial variation of groundwater levels is investigated by a novel method known as Fixed Rank Kriging (FRK). The results demonstrate that ARIMA outperforms HWES in fitting the training data. In contrast, the 95% confidence bound of ARIMA predictions is wider than that of HWES and ARIMA's predicted seasonal cycle is weaker. The time series forecasting by a stochastic simulation indicated that if the current situation continues, the level of groundwater is expected to decline from 1635 m to about 1605 m by 2022.

abstract = {Accurate prediction of crude oil prices is meaningful for reducing firm risks, stabilizing commodity prices and maintaining national financial security. Wrong crude oil price forecasts can bring huge losses to governments, enterprises, investors and even cause economic and social instability. Many classic econometrics and computational approaches show good performance for the ordinary time series prediction tasks, but not satisfactory in crude oil price predictions. They ignore the characteristics of non-linearity and non-stationarity of crude oil prices data, which hinder an accurate prediction and eventually lead to poor accuracy or the wrong result. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and ensemble EMD (EEMD) solve the problems of non-stationary time series forecasting, but they also generate new problems of mode mixing and reconstruction errors. We propose a hybrid method that is combination of the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and multi-layer gated recurrent unit (ML-GRU) neural network to solve the abovementioned issues. This not only deals with the issue of mode mixing effectively, but also makes the reconstruction error of data close to zero. Multi-layer GRU has an excellent ability of nonlinear data-fitting.

We employ the space of Koopman model forms equipped with distance in conjunction with classical machine learning techniques to develop a framework for automatic feature generation for time series classification.

To overcome these shortcomings, this paper builds trend fuzzy granulation based long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to carry out long-term forecasting, where data points with consistent trend characteristics including trend change, fluctuation range and trend persistence are predicted in unison rather than individually. Noticing that these trend characteristics are more urgently needed than just magnitude information, a question on how to granulate a time series into a granular time series consists of meaningful granules containing trend information comes to be a crucial step. Only if the established granules fit the varying patterns of time series at utmost can such granulation make sense for the improvement of the forecasting accuracy, thus an optimization method of trend-oriented fuzzy granulation is proposed to meliorate the granulation results. With the built trend fuzzy granulation based LSTM networks, the successive iterations of one-step forecasting are prevented, and the prediction errors of data within a granule will not further increase. This is the first attempt to build trend fuzzy granule based LSTM to predict trend characteristics.

The presence of correlation (i.e. spatial correlation across several sites and time correlation within each site) poses difficulties with respect to traditional modeling, computation and statistical theory. This paper presents a cluster-centric forecasting methodology that allows us to yield a characterization of correlation in geophysical time series through a spatio-temporal clustering step. The clustering phase is designed for partitioning time series of numeric data routinely sampled at specific space locations. A forecasting model is then computed by resorting to multivariate time series analysis, in order to predict the future values of a time series by utilizing not only its own historical values, but also information from other cluster-time series. Experimental results highlight the importance of dealing with both temporal and spatial correlation and validate the proposed cluster-centric strategy in the computation of a multivariate time series forecasting model.},

Forecasting the energy consumption in buildings is essential for improving energy efficiency and sustainable development, and thereby reducing energy costs and environmental impact. This investigation presents a comprehensive review of machine learning (ML) techniques for forecasting energy consumption time series using actual data. Real-time data were collected from a smart grid that was installed in an experimental building and used to evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of statistical and ML techniques. Well-known artificial intelligence techniques were used to analyze energy consumption in single and ensemble scenarios. An in-depth review and analysis of the ‘hybrid model' that combines forecasting and optimization techniques is presented. The comprehensive comparison demonstrates that the hybrid model is more accurate than the single and ensemble models. Both the accuracy of prediction and the suitability for use of these models are considered to support users in planning energy management.},

abstract = {Networks encode dependencies between entities (people, computers, proteins) and allow us to study phenomena across social, technological, and biological domains. These networks naturally evolve over time by the addition, deletion, and changing of links, nodes, and attributes. Despite the importance of modeling these dynamics, existing work in relational machine learning has ignored relational time series data. Relational time series learning lies at the intersection of traditional time series analysis and statistical relational learning, and bridges the gap between these two fundamentally important problems. This paper formulates the relational time series learning problem, and a general framework and taxonomy for representation discovery tasks of both nodes and links including predicting their existence, label, and weight (importance), as well as systematically constructing features. We also reinterpret the prediction task leading to the proposal of two important relational time series forecasting tasks consisting of (i) relational time series classification (predicts a future class or label of an entity), and (ii) relational time series regression (predicts a future real-valued attribute or weight). Relational time series models are designed to leverage both relational and temporal dependencies to minimize forecasting error for both relational time series classification and regression. Finally, we discuss challenges and open problems that remain to be addressed.},

The FTSF methods consist of four stages namely determination of effective length of interval, fuzzification of crisp time series data, modeling of fuzzy logical relationships (FLRs) and defuzzification. All the four stages play a vital role in achieving better forecasting accuracy. This paper addresses two key issues such as modeling FLRs and determination of effective length of interval. Three leading machine learning (ML) techniques, namely deep belief network (DBN), long short-term memory (LSTM) and support vector machine (SVM) are first time used for modeling the FLRs. Additionally, a modified average-based method is proposed to estimate the effective length of interval. The proposed FTSF-DBN, FTSF-LSTM and FTSF-SVM methods are being compared with three papers from the literature along with four crisp TSF methods using multilayer perceptron (MLP), LSTM, DBN and SVM. A total of fourteen time series datasets (Sun Spot, Lynx, Mumps and 11 TAIEX time series datasets i.e. 2000–2010) are considered for comparative performance analysis. Results revealed the statistical superiority of FTSF-SVM method and proposed improved average-based method based on the popular Friedman and Nemenyi hypothesis test.

abstract = {It is a well-known fact that improving forecasting accuracy is an important yet often challenging issue. Extensive research has been conducted using neural networks (NNs) to improve their forecasting accuracy. In general, the inputs to NNs are the auto-regressive (i.e. lagged variables) of one or more time series. In addition, either network outputs or network errors have been used as extra inputs to NNs. In this paper, however, we propose a novel recurrent neural network forecasting model which is called the ridge polynomial neural network with error-output feedbacks (RPNN-EOF). RPNN-EOF has two main types of inputs: auto-regressive and moving-average inputs. The former is represented by the lagged variables of a time series, while the latter is represented by feeding back network error to the input layer. In addition, network output is fed back to the input layer. The proposed recurrent model has the ability to produce more accurate forecasts due to the advantages of learning temporal dependence and the direct modelling of the moving-average component. A comparative analysis of RPNN-EOF with five neural network models was completed using ten time series. Simulation results have shown that RPNN-EOF is the most accurate model among all the compared models with the time series used. This shows that employing auto-regressive and moving-average inputs together helps to produce more accurate forecasts.},

abstract = {Time series prediction has attracted much attention as various issues can be formulated as such a task. It is one of the critical challenges to extract the intrinsic information for estimating future trends from historical data. Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) shows excellent performance in this assignment. Probabilistic information extraction, which is demonstrated effective in object recognition in recent years, has not been introduced in time series prediction. To our knowledge, there has not been any work on plugging trainable probability distributions into LSTM as feature representation in an end-to-end manner. In this work we put forward an Adaptive Log-Euclidean Gaussian embedding Network (ALGeNet) to take one step further on solving this problem. The core of the network is capturing statistical information through the Gaussian Distribution with LSTM for end-to-end learning. As the space of Gaussian Distribution is a manifold, we try to embed Gaussian layer into LSTM through mapping Gaussian space into a linear space based on the Lie group and logarithm operation. We introduce four descriptors of Gaussian, two descriptors performing direct logarithm and the others performing indirect logarithm. All of them can extract first-order and second-order statistical features while utilizing the structures of geometry and smooth group of Gaussians. Furthermore, our adaptive mechanism merges the advantages of each descriptor and works well. Experimental results on a real-world wind speed dataset and a system-level electricity load dataset show that the proposed adaptive network outperforms some state-of-the-art algorithms.},

abstract = {Web Services (WSs) constitute a critical component of modern software development. Knowing the dynamic qualities of WSs is mandatory during use, and these qualities vary continuously over time. However, in most cases, the quality information furnished by service providers is static and does not consider dynamic variations in quality over time. Thus, it is necessary to determine a method for acquiring accurate quality values for WSs. The motivation for this research is that the most suitable time-series method for dynamic quality prediction of WSs remains unknown because no comprehensive empirical comparison of the representative time-series methods has been performed. Therefore, in this paper, we implement all the representative time-series methods and compare their dynamic quality predictions for WSs using a real-world quality dataset. For empirical comparison, we have ensured that our study is reproducible and referenceable by providing diverse specifics and evaluating their validity in detail. The experimental results and diverse discussions presented in this paper may act as a valuable reference to both academic researchers and WS consumers and providers in industry because they can depend on the results when selecting the most suitable time-series method for direct use or as a starting point for further modifications. Based on our experimental results, among the included time-series forecasting approaches, genetic programming (GP) can achieve the highest quality of service (QoS) forecasting accuracy (in our experiments, the average mean absolute error and mean absolute percentage error are 1258 and 20%, respectively); however, this approach also requires the longest time to produce a QoS predictor (67.7 s on average). Though auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA, with average error measures of 1343 and 25.4%) and exponential smoothing (ES, with average error measures of 1354 and 25.7%) present slightly worse accuracy than GP, ARIMA and ES require much less time to generate a predictor than GP (on average, 0.1612 and 0.1519 s, respectively); thus, these approaches might represent a compromise between forecasting accuracy and cost.},

On the other hand, hospitals and blood centers experience severe blood shortage due to the very limited donor population. Therefore, the necessity to forecast the blood supply to minimize outdating as well as shortage is obvious. This study aims to efficiently forecast the supply of blood components at blood centers. Methods. Two different types of forecasting techniques, time series and machine learning algorithms, are developed and the best performing method for the given case study is determined. Under the time series, we consider the Autoregressive (AUTOREG), Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Seasonal ARIMA, Seasonal Exponential Smoothing Method (ESM), and Holt-Winters models. Artificial neural network (ANN) and multiple regression are considered under the machine learning algorithms. Results. We leverage five years worth of historical blood supply data from the Taiwan Blood Services Foundation (TBSF) to conduct our study. On comparing the different techniques, we found that time series forecasting methods yield better results than machine learning algorithms. More specifically, the least value of the error measures is observed in seasonal ESM and ARIMA models. Conclusions. The models developed can act as a decision support system to administrators and pathologists at blood banks, blood donation centers, and hospitals to determine their inventory policy based on the estimated future blood supply.

The accurately forecasted CCI using the presented model will help in budget and bid planning as well as assessing the risk of future businesses.},

In addition, in a dynamic environment such as the stock market, the nonlinearity of the time series is pronounced, immediately affecting the efficacy of stock price forecasts. Thus, this paper proposes an intelligent time series prediction system that uses sliding-window metaheuristic optimization for the purpose of predicting the stock prices of Taiwan construction companies one step ahead. It may be of great interest to home brokers who do not possess sufficient knowledge to invest in such companies. The system has a graphical user interface and functions as a stand-alone application. The developed hybrid system exhibited outstanding prediction performance and it improves overall profit for investment performance. The proposed model is a promising predictive technique for highly nonlinear time series, whose patterns are difficult to capture by traditional models.},

It is becoming a mainstream technology for pattern recognition, data mining and intelligent control at industrial scale. Previous work on constructing very deep networks, such as convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network, makes complex tasks such as image classification feasible. However, they are very limited when dealing with irregular data whose features are unstructured or even unknown. The traditional fully connected neural network is contrarily too shallow to extract high-level features. In this paper, we present a balance gate controlled deep network structure to deepen the fully connected neural network. It uses a new gating strategy to control information flow and increase network stability. Experimental results on both irregular regression and time-series forecasting demonstrate that the proposed network out-performs other ad-hoc models and is easier to train in a deeper form than the fully connected neural network.},

abstract = {Forecasting of multivariate time series data, for instance the prediction of electricity consumption, solar power production, and polyphonic piano pieces, has numerous valuable applications. However, complex and non-linear interdependencies between time steps and series complicate this task. To obtain accurate prediction, it is crucial to model long-term dependency in time series data, which can be achieved by recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with an attention mechanism. The typical attention mechanism reviews the information at each previous time step and selects relevant information to help generate the outputs; however, it fails to capture temporal patterns across multiple time steps. In this paper, we propose using a set of filters to extract time-invariant temporal patterns, similar to transforming time series data into its “frequency domain”. Then we propose a novel attention mechanism to select relevant time series, and use its frequency domain information for multivariate forecasting. We apply the proposed model on several real-world tasks and achieve state-of-the-art performance in almost all of cases. Our source code is available at https://github.com/gantheory/TPA-LSTM.},

abstract = {Stock return forecasting typically requires a large number of factors and these factors usually exhibit nonlinear relations with each other. Conventional methods of stock return forecasting mainly fall into two categories: Technical Analysis and Fundamental Analysis. Technical Analysis focuses on time-series data, while Fundamental Analysis explores low-frequency fundamental variables. Although there are substantial works on either time-series analysis or fundamental analysis, few studies have enriched the time-series forecasting with fundamental variables, as the features are characterized by different frequencies, scales and types. In this paper, we propose a Long Short-Term Memory and Deep Neural Network (LSTM-DNN) hybrid model to integrate the fundamental information into time-series forecasting tasks. We demonstrate how investors can benefit from the superior performance of LSTM-DNN by constructing a long-short portfolio that takes long positions in stocks with the highest forecasting returns and short positions in stocks that are expected to decline. Extensive experimental results on real data show that our novel framework could improve the profitability of long-short portfolio strategies compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. We also find evidence indicating that the outperformance of LSTM-DNN model comes from its enhanced ability to extract information from the nonlinear relations among various features, rather than bearing more market risks. Besides the novel framework, we propose a cross-section normalization method, which benefits the framework by providing enriched cross-section signals.},

abstract = {Climate change projections indicate that the world's most populated regions will experience more frequent, intense and longer-lasting heatwave periods over the coming decades. Such events are likely to result in widespread overheating in the built environment, with a consequential increase in heat-related morbidity and mortality. In order to warn the population of such risks, Heat-Health Warning Systems (HHWSs) are being progressively adopted world-wide. Current HHWSs are, however, based solely on weather observations and forecasts and are unable to identify precisely where, when, or to what extent individual buildings (and their occupants) will be affected. In contrast, AutoRegressive models with eXogenous inputs (ARX) have been demonstrated to reliably forecast indoor temperatures in individual rooms using minimal data. Thus, the large-scale deployment of forecasting models could theoretically enable the development of a high-resolution indoor HHWS (iHHWS). In this study, ARX models were tested over the long-lasting UK heatwave of 2018 using hourly monitored dry-bulb temperature data from 25 rooms (12 living rooms and 13 bedrooms) in 12 dwellings, located within the London Urban Heat Island (UHI). The study investigates different approaches to improving the reliability of room-based heat exposure predictions at longer forecasting horizons. The effectiveness of the iHHWS system was assessed by evaluating the accuracy of predictions (using fixed and adaptive temperature thresholds) at different lead times (1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h ahead). Compared to forecasted indoor temperatures, a Cumulative Heat Index (CHI) metric was shown to increase the reliability of heat-health warnings up to 24 h ahead.},

abstract = {Diabetes mellitus is a widespread chronic disease and is one of the main causes of death worldwide. In order to improve the quality of life of people with diabetes and reduce the occurrence of complications, it is fundamental to prevent glycemic levels from exceeding the physiologic range. With this purpose, many works in recent years have been developed to forecast future glycemic trends using machine learning algorithms that exploit the reading of continuous glucose monitoring sensors, which gather glycemic data from diabetic patients 24 h a day. However, their application is limited in practice by the fact that they usually require a large amount of training data and other heterogeneous features gathered from patients. For this reason, in this work we present a novel neural network capable of predicting future glycemic levels using only the past glucose values as input while needing a small amount of training data. The model is a jump neural network with the addition of feedback connections from the output to the hidden layer, and time delays for each of the input-to-hidden, output-to-hidden and input-to-output connections. Experiments were conducted on a private and a public dataset. We evaluated performance in terms of RMSE and of adverse event detection.

This issue is even more apparent when DL is used for financial time series forecasting tasks, where the nonstationary and multimodal nature of the data pose significant challenges and severely affect the performance of DL models. In this brief, a simple, yet effective, neural layer that is capable of adaptively normalizing the input time series, while taking into account the distribution of the data, is proposed. The proposed layer is trained in an end-to-end fashion using backpropagation and leads to significant performance improvements compared to other evaluated normalization schemes. The proposed method differs from traditional normalization methods since it learns how to perform normalization for a given task instead of using a fixed normalization scheme. At the same time, it can be directly applied to any new time series without requiring retraining. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using a large-scale limit order book data set, as well as a load forecasting data set.},

abstract = {Many variables in our environment are impacted by alternations in soil temperature (Ts ). Fluctuations in Ts  alter gas absorption and emission capacity of the soil, which mutually influence climate changes. Hence, providing viable methodologies of modeling Ts  is of great importance. Since thorough investigations of time series structure are mostly neglected, and appropriate pre-processing methods are not applied to them, the direct use of nonlinear methods for soil temperature forecasting has become more common than other approaches. In this study, unlike most of the existing studies that estimate Ts  as a variables based approach, soil temperature is forecasted using a linear stochastic based methodology with sufficient knowledge of time series structure. With this methodology, the components of the Ts  time series are determined in order to perform stochastic modeling using Holt-Winters advanced exponential smoothing. The results of this procedure are compared with two stochastic techniques based on seasonal standardization (std$\omega$) and spectral analysis (sf) in terms of six Ts  time series at each station. The Ts . time series applied in the current study were measured at Bandar Abbas and Kerman synoptic stations, Iran, at depths of 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, and 100 cm. Owing to the comparison of the applied techniques in different Ts  time series analysis, the stochastic model with Holt-Winters advanced exponential smoothing (Bandar Abbas station: (R % = 96.649, RMSE = 0.977, MAPE% = 1.963, AICc = −733.006; Kerman station: R % = 92.416, RMSE = 1.806, MAPE% = 7.793, AICc = 360.410) outperformed the std$\omega$ and sf methods. In addition to comparing linear stochastic methods, the results of Ts  modeling are compared with two powerful nonlinear methods. In an antecedent study on the mentioned sites, Nahvi et al. (2016) employed extreme learning machine (ELM) and self-adaptive evolutionary ELM (SaE-ELM) nonlinear techniques. A comparison of results indicates that the proposed methodology outperformed the nonlinear models (ELM and SaE-ELM). Indeed, the proposed linear based stochastic model not only enhanced forecasting accuracy but also demonstrated the capability of linear models in Ts  time series forecasting. Concerning the comprehensibility and generality of the framework, it can apply to other stations with different climatological conditions. oc oc oc oc oc oc oc oc 2 2 oc oc},

Several studies have sought to develop more accurate models to predict the future exchange rate by analyzing econometric models, developing artificial intelligence models and combining both through the creation of hybrid models. This paper proposes a hybrid model for forecasting the variations of five exchange rates related to the US Dollar: Euro, British Pound, Japanese Yen, Swiss Franc and Canadian Dollar. The proposed model uses Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to deconstruct the series into independent components as well as neural networks (NN) to predict each component. This method differentiates this study from previous works where ICA has been used to extract the noise of time series or used to obtain explanatory variables that are then used in forecasting. The proposed model is then compared to random walk, autoregressive and conditional variance models, neural networks, recurrent neural networks and long–short term memory neural networks. The hypothesis of this study supposes that first deconstructing the exchange rate series and then predicting it separately would produce better forecasts than traditional models. By using the mean squared error and mean absolute percentage error as a measures of performance and Model Confidence Sets to statistically test the superiority of the proposed model, our results showed that this model outperformed the other models examined and significantly improved the accuracy of forecasts. These findings support this model's use in future research and in decision-making related to investments.},

One such fresh water source is Vrana Lake, located on the completely karstified Island of Cres in Croatia. Over the last few decades a severe and dangerous decrease of the lake level has been documented. In order to develop a reliable lake level prediction, the application of the artificial neural networks (ANN) was used for the first time. The paper proposes time-series forecasting models based on the monthly measurements of the lake level during the last 38 years, capable to predict 6 or 12 months ahead. In order to gain the best possible model performance, the forecasting models were built using two types of ANN: the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN), and the feed forward neural network (FFNN). Instead of classic lagged data set, the proposed models were trained with the set of sequences with different length created from the time series data. The models were trained with the same set of the training parameters in order to establish the same conditions for the performance analysis. Based on root mean squared error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient (R) the performance analysis shown that both model types can achieve satisfactory results. The analysis also revealed that regardless of the model types, they outperform classic ANN models based on datasets with fixed number of features and one month the prediction period. Analysis also revealed that the proposed models outperform classic time series forecasting models based on ARIMA and other similar methods.},

abstract = {This paper presents a comparison of the impact of various unsupervised ensemble learning methods on electricity load forecasting. The electricity load from consumers is simply aggregated or optimally clustered to more predictable groups by cluster analysis. The clustering approach consists of efficient preprocessing of data obtained from smart meters by a model-based representation and the K-means method. We have implemented two types of unsupervised ensemble learning methods to investigate the performance of forecasting on clustered or simply aggregated load: bootstrap aggregating based and the newly proposed density-clustering based. Three new bootstrapping methods for time series analysis methods were newly proposed in order to handle the noisy behaviour of time series. The smart meter datasets used in our experiments come from Australia, London, and Ireland, where data from residential consumers were available. The achieved results suggest that for extremely fluctuating and noisy time series the forecasting accuracy improvement through the bagging can be a challenging task. However, our experimental evaluation shows that in most of the cases the density-based unsupervised ensemble learning methods are significantly improving forecasting accuracy of aggregated or clustered electricity load.},

abstract = {Artificial neural networks have been used for time series modeling and forecasting in many domains. However, they are often limited in their handling of nonlinear and chaotic data. More recently, reservoir-based recurrent neural net systems, most notably echo state networks (ESN), have made substantial improvements for time series modeling. Their shallow nature lends themselves to an efficient training method, but has limitations on nonstationary, nonlinear chaotic time series, particularly large, multidimensional time series. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for forecasting time series data based on an additive decomposition (AD) applied to the time series as a preprocessor to a deep echo state network. We compare the performance of our method, AD-DeepESN, on popular neural net architectures used for time series prediction. Stationary and nonstationary data sets are used to evaluate the performance of the methods. Our results are compelling, demonstrating that AD-DeepESN has superior performance, particularly on the most challenging time series that exhibit non-stationarity and chaotic behavior compared to existing methods.},

abstract = {Time series forecasting is of fundamental importance in big data analysis. The prediction of noisy, non-stationary, and chaotic time series demands good generalization from small amounts of data. Vapnik showed that the total risk is dependent on both, empirical error as well as model complexity, where the latter may be measured in terms of the Vapnik–Chervonenkis (VC) dimension. In other words, good generalization requires minimizing model complexity. The recently proposed Minimal Complexity Machine (MCM) has been shown to minimize a tight bound on the VC dimension, and has further been extended to Minimal Complexity Machine Regression (MCMR). In this paper, we present an original approach based on the MCM regressor, which builds sparse and accurate models for short-term time series forecasting. Results on a number of datasets establish that the proposed approach is superior to a number of state-of-the-art methods, and yields sparse models. These sparse models are able to extract only the most important information present in the data sets, thereby achieving high accuracy. Sparsity in time series forecasting models is also important in reducing the evaluation time. This assumes importance when the models need to be evaluated in real time, such as when they are used as part of trading flows.},

Prevention plays a key role in these actions plan and, in this context, we propose the use of Artificial Intelligence, specifically Time Series Forecasting techniques, for predicting future outbreaks of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Infection incidence forecasting is approached as a Feature Selection based Time Series Forecasting problem using multivariate time series composed of incidence of Staphylococcus aureus Methicillin-sensible and MRSA infections, influenza incidence and total days of therapy of both of Levofloxacin and Oseltamivir antimicrobials. Data were collected from the University Hospital of Getafe (Spain) from January 2009 to January 2018, using months as time granularity. The main contributions of the work are the following: the applications of wrapper feature selection methods where the search strategy is based on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) along with evaluators based on the most powerful state-of-the-art regression algorithms. The performance of the feature selection methods has been measured using the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) performance metrics. A novel multi-criteria decision-making process is proposed in order to select the most satisfactory forecasting model, using the metrics previously mentioned, as well as the slopes of model prediction lines in the 1, 2 and 3 steps-ahead predictions. The multi-criteria decision-making process is applied to the best models resulting from a ranking of databases and regression algorithms obtained through multiple statistical tests. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a feature selection based multivariate time series methodology is proposed for antibiotic resistance forecasting. Final results show that the best model according to the proposed multi-criteria decision making process provides a RMSE = (0.1349, 0.1304, 0.1325) and a MAE = (0.1003, 0.096, 0.0987) for 1, 2, and 3 steps-ahead predictions.},

abstract = {National economy and growth rely heavily on electricity but rapid urbanization, expeditious industrialization and increased domestic use due to population growth are among the reasons for the severe energy crisis in developing countries. The extended demand-supply gaps, depleting reservoirs of fossil fuel, and the environmental hazards altogether ignite the need for wider adoption of renewable energy resources for electricity generation. A functional assessment of the engineering design for this transition is a prerequisite before proceeding to on-ground implementation due to its high impact on system sustainability. To this end, we propose an agent-based modeling and simulation framework for the rapid prototyping of wind power plants. The proposed approach abstracts active components of wind power plants using agents and implements their dynamic behavior through agent interactions. The proposed model helps in composing different model components, design valuation, and forecasting energy generation in a cost-effective and productive manner. The proposed model is demonstrated by conceptualizing the design of the Foundation Wind Energy plant, located at Sindh, Pakistan, and the development of its agent-based model. The obtained short-term and long-term electricity generation profiles are validated with the actual data. We further compared the forecasts with the time series analysis performed on the actual data, using five different time-series forecasting models. The proposed simulation model and time series analysis model fit well on the actual data with a root mean square deviation of approximately 9 MW. The proposed framework will assist the policymakers in estimating the extent of electrical energy produced at given conditions using the wind potential available at the corridors of any country. It will further aid in the realistic analysis of the future dynamics of electricity demand and supply, hence help in effective energy planning.},

abstract = {The Yinsong Water Diversion Project in China's northeast region contains a 20 km long tunnel section, which was drilled by a tunnel boring machine (TBM) and monitored in real time to generate continuously measured data. During the tunnel construction, 18 tunnel wall collapse failures were documented. This study reviews the boring performance of the TBM during these failures based on the field-collected data for the penetration rate, cutterhead rotation speed, torque, and thrust force, which were obtained at a 1-second interval. The main task in this study includes the development of a time series forecasting (TSF) approach combined with a deep belief network (DBN) that predicts the torque associated with a given penetration rate and rotation speed through a parameter called the drilling efficiency index, TPI, in a neural network. This study begins with a pilot case of a tunnel collapse that eventually caused the TBM construction to be abandoned. In this case, the TSF&DBN algorithm clearly identifies the deviations of the observed TPI values from those given by the neural network, indicating the successful prediction of an unfavorable geological condition. In addition, the cases of 13 other collapse sections are reviewed; of these, 11 clearly exhibit similar performance to the pilot case, whereas the remaining 2 provide no sufficient indications to exclude possible unstable roofs. This preliminary study shows that a systematic and high-quality TBM performance database can be useful in diagnosing adverse geological conditions in conjunction with the proper use of big data and machine learning techniques.},

The high-dimensionality, velocity and variety of the data collected in many of these applications pose significant and unique challenges that must be carefully addressed for each of them. In this work, a novel Temporal Logistic Neural Bag-of-Features approach, that can be used to tackle these challenges, is proposed. The proposed method can be effectively combined with deep neural networks, leading to powerful deep learning models for time series analysis. However, combining existing BoF formulations with deep feature extractors pose significant challenges: the distribution of the input features is not stationary, tuning the hyper-parameters of the model can be especially difficult and the normalizations involved in the BoF model can cause significant instabilities during the training process. The proposed method is capable of overcoming these limitations by a employing a novel adaptive scaling mechanism and replacing the classical Gaussian-based density estimation involved in the regular BoF model with a logistic kernel. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using extensive experiments on a large-scale limit order book dataset that consists of more than 4 million limit orders.},

abstract = {High-frequency monitoring of agrometeorological parameters is quintessential in the domain of Precision Agriculture (PA), where timeliness of collected observations and the ability to generate ahead-of-time predictions can substantially impact the crop yield. In this context, state-of-the-art internet-of-things (IoT)-based sensing platforms are often employed to generate, pre-process and assimilate real-time data from heterogeneous sensors and streaming data sources. Simultaneously, Time-Series Forecasting Algorithms (TSFAs) are responsible for generating reliable forecasts with a pre-defined forecast horizon and confidence. These TSFAs often rely on modelling the correlation between endogenous variables, the impact of exogenous variables on latent form and structural properties of data such as autocorrelation, periodicity, trend, pattern, and causality to approximate the model parameters. Traditionally, TSFAs such as the Holt–Winters (HW) and Autoregressive family of models (ARIMA) apply a linear and parametric approach towards model approximation, whilst models like Support Vector Regression (SVRs) and Neural Networks (NNs) adhere to a non-linear, non-parametric approach for modelling the historical data. Recently, Deep-Learning-based TSFAs such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTMS) have gained popularity due to their capability to model long sequences of highly non-linear and stochastic data effectively. However, the evolution of TSFAs for predicting agrometeorological parameters pivots around one-step-ahead forecasting, which often overestimates the performance metrics defined for validating forecast capabilities of potential TSFAs. Hence, this paper attempts to evaluate and compare the performance of different machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) based TSFAs under one-step and multi-step-ahead forecast scenarios, thereby estimating the generalization capabilities of TSFA models over unseen data. The data used in this study are collected from an Automatic Weather Station (AWS), sampled at an interval of 15 min, and range over one month. Temperature (T) and Humidity (H) observations from the AWS are further converted into univariate, supervised time-series diurnal data profiles. Finally, walk-forward validation is used to evaluate recursive one-step-ahead forecasts until the desired prediction horizon is achieved. The results show that the Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) and SVR models outperform their DL-based counterparts in one-step and multi-step ahead settings with a fixed forecast horizon. This work aims to present a baseline comparison between different TSFAs to assist the process of model selection and facilitate rapid ahead-of-time forecasting for end-user applications.},

In the paper, we proposed an ensemble-based forecast combination methodology as an alternative approach to forecasting methods for time series prediction. The ensemble learning technique combines various learning algorithms, including SOGA (structure optimization genetic algorithm)-based FCMs, RCGA (real coded genetic algorithm)-based FCMs, efficient and adaptive ANNs architectures, and a hybrid structure of FCM-ANN, recently proposed for time series forecasting. All ensemble algorithms execute according to the one-step prediction regime.

The suggested ensemble learning approach was applied to three distribution points that compose the natural gas grid of a Greek region. For the evaluation of the proposed approach, a real-time series dataset for natural gas prediction was used. We also provided a detailed discussion on the performance of the individual predictors, the ensemble predictors, and their combination through two well-known ensemble methods (the average and the error-based) that are characterized in the literature as particularly accurate and effective.

However, the wavelet-based versions of these techniques, respectively denoted as W-MMSE, W-Kalman and W-ANN, rather than the original techniques themselves, have been found to possess better capabilities in forecasting the highly nonlinear geophysical data. Using the original and predicted data, these observations have been validated by determining the RMSE (root mean squared error) and correlation coefficients between them. The prediction capabilities of both versions of the above techniques are tested on (i) the ionospheric total electron content (TEC) data, (ii) the daily average rainfall data and (iii) the gamma-ray log data from an offshore oil well, off the west coast of India. The TEC and daily average rainfall data sets designate as examples of data with very high correlations pertaining over very large lags. They also have a strong seasonality component associated with them. However, the gamma-ray log data sets show no seasonality component and have no trends associated with them. Therefore, the choice of different nonlinear data sets having diverse sources of their origins are apt to test the forecasting capabilities of these techniques. It has been observed that W-ANN gives the best prediction, when compared with the other algorithms discussed in this paper. This is believed to be due to the use of non-linear activation function by ANNs to produce regression that results in capturing the inherent non-linear dynamics of the process effectively. The results also show the usefulness of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coefficients as training features for both linear and non-linear forecasting approaches. The better performance of the wavelet-based forecasting algorithms can be attributed to the fact that DWT coefficients are wide-sense stationary sequences. Thus the wavelet-based versions of these models like W-MMSE and W-Kalman provide better fit to these coefficients, compared to the original time-series data itself.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel support vector regression (SVR) approach for time series analysis. An efficient forward feature selection strategy has been designed for dealing with high-frequency time series with multiple seasonal periods. Inspired by the literature on feature selection for support vector classification, we designed a technique for assessing the contribution of additional covariates to the SVR solution, including them in a forward fashion. Our strategy extends the reasoning behind Auto-ARIMA, a well-known approach for automatic model specification for traditional time series analysis, to kernel machines. Experiments on well-known high-frequency datasets demonstrate the virtues of the proposed method in terms of predictive performance, confirming the virtues of an automatic model specification strategy and the use of nonlinear predictors in time series forecasting. Our empirical analysis focus on the energy load forecasting task, which is arguably the most popular application for high-frequency, multi-seasonal time series forecasting.},

abstract = {Wind power generation has presented an important development around the world. However, its integration into electrical systems presents numerous challenges due to the variable nature of the wind. Therefore, to maintain an economical and reliable electricity supply, it is necessary to accurately predict wind generation. The Wind Power Prediction Tool (WPPT) has been proposed to solve this task using the power curve associated with a wind farm. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) model complex non-linear relationships without requiring explicit mathematical expressions that relate the variables involved. In particular, two types of RNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Echo State Network (ESN), have shown good results in time series forecasting. In this work, we present an LSTM+ESN architecture that combines the characteristics of both networks. An architecture similar to an ESN is proposed, but using LSTM blocks as units in the hidden layer. The training process of this network has two key stages: (i) the hidden layer is trained with a descending gradient method online using one epoch; (ii) the output layer is adjusted with a regularized regression. In particular, the case is proposed where Step (i) is used as a target for the input signal, in order to extract characteristics automatically as the autoencoder approach; and in the second stage (ii), a quantile regression is used in order to obtain a robust estimate of the expected target. The experimental results show that LSTM+ESN using the autoencoder and quantile regression outperforms the WPPT model in all global metrics used.},

abstract = {Crude oil is one of the most important types of energy and its prices have a great impact on the global economy. Therefore, forecasting crude oil prices accurately is an essential task for investors, governments, enterprises and even researchers. However, due to the extreme nonlinearity and nonstationarity of crude oil prices, it is a challenging task for the traditional methodologies of time series forecasting to handle it. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel approach that incorporates ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), sparse Bayesian learning (SBL), and addition, namely EEMD-SBL-ADD, for forecasting crude oil prices, following the "decomposition and ensemble" framework that is widely used in time series analysis. Specifically, EEMD is first used to decompose the raw crude oil price data into components, including several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and one residue. Then, we apply SBL to build an individual forecasting model for each component. Finally, the individual forecasting results are aggregated as the final forecasting price by simple addition. To validate the performance of the proposed EEMD-SBL-ADD, we use the publicly-availableWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent crude oil spot prices as experimental data. The experimental results demonstrate that the EEMD-SBL-ADD outperforms some state-of-the-art forecasting methodologies in terms of several evaluation criteria such as the mean absolute percent error (MAPE), the root mean squared error (RMSE), the directional statistic (Dstat), the Diebold-Mariano (DM) test, the model confidence set (MCS) test and running time, indicating that the proposed EEMD-SBL-ADD is promising for forecasting crude oil prices.},

abstract = {Time series forecasting has important theoretical significance and engineering application value. A number of studies have shown that hybrid modelling is very successful in various modelling applications, and both theoretical and empirical findings have shown that hybrid modelling is an effective method to improve the accuracy of time series models. This paper proposes a hybrid model that combines a linear regression (LR) model and deep belief network (DBN) model for the prediction of time series data. In the hybrid model, the linear AR (auto-regression) LR model or ARIMA (auto-regressive integrated moving average) model and the nonlinear DBN model are explored to capture the linear and nonlinear behaviours of a time series, respectively. We first use an LR model to fit the original data and obtain the LR model residuals between the original data and the predicted data of the LR model. Then, the residuals are regarded as the nonlinear component and are used as inputs into the DBN model. The LR model prediction and the output of the DBN model are the final forecasting value for the time series, which takes full advantage of the two models for predicting time series. The proposed hybrid model and other existing models are applied to four well-known time series for comparison, and the results show that the proposed hybrid model has a high prediction accuracy and may be a useful tool for time series forecasting.},

The annual runoff data series of three huge hydropower reservoirs in China are chosen to testify the performance of the proposed forecasting model.

Therefore, it is of great importance to improve the quality of streamflow series forecasting by investigating state-of-the-art time series forecasting algorithms. To this end, this work proposes the development of ensembles of unorganized machines, namely Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) and Echo State Networks (ESNs). Two primary contributions are proposed: (1) a new training logic for ESNs that enables the application of bootstrap aggregation (bagging); and (2) the employment of multi-objective optimization to select and adjust the weights of the ensemble's base models, taking into account the trade-off between bias and variance. Experiments are conducted on streamflow series data from five real-world Brazilian hydroelectric plants, namely those in Sobradinho, Serra da Mesa, Jira{\'{u}}, Furnas and {\'{A}}gua Vermelha. The statistical results for four different prediction horizons (1, 3, 6, and 12 months ahead) indicate that the ensembles of unorganized machines achieve better results than autoregressive (AR) models in terms of the Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R ), and RMSE-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR). In such results, the ensembles with ESNs and the multi-objective optimization design procedure achieve the best scores. 2},

India implemented a complete shutdown across the nation from March 25, 2020 as lockdown I and went on to extend it by giving timely partial relaxations in the form of lockdown II, III & IV. This paper statistically analyses the impact of relaxation during Lockdown III and IV on coronavirus disease (COVID) spread in India using the Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) to forecast the number of active cases using time series analysis and hence the required medical infrastructure for the period of next six months. The Group Method of Data Handling is a novel self organized data mining technique with data driven adaptive learning capability which grasps the auto correlative relations between the samples and gives a high forecasting accuracy irrespective of the length and stochasticity of a time series. The GMDH model has been first validated and standardized by forecasting the number of active and confirmed cases during lockdown III-IV with an accuracy of 2.58% and 2.00% respectively. Thereafter, the number of active cases has been forecasted for the rest of 2020 to predict the impact of lockdown relaxation on spread of COVID-19 and indicate preparatory measures necessary to counter it.},

As one of the effective forecast methods, machine learning (ML) methods are employed for wind speed time series forecasting because the excellent ability in fitting the relationship between data and cost function.

In this paper, a novel hybrid supervised approach is proposed to solve the above problems. The proposed approach has adopted local convolutional neural networks (LCNNs) for convexity preserving of the cost function, in this way, a non-convex problem can be transformed as a convex problem so that heuristic optimization algorithms is adopted to find optimal parameters, and it helps to construct a more stable model. Highway Gate (HG) algorithm is adopted to decrease the computation complexity of the proposed model.

abstract = {With the rapid development of the Internet of things (IoT), building IoT systems with high quality of service (QoS) has become an urgent requirement in both academia and industry. During the procedures of building IoT systems, QoS-aware service selection is an important concern, which requires the ranking of a set of functionally similar services according to their QoS values. In reality, however, it is quite expensive and even impractical to evaluate all geographically-dispersed IoT services at a single client to obtain such a ranking. Nevertheless, distributed measurement and ranking aggregation have to deal with the high dynamics of QoS values and the inconsistency of partial rankings. To address these challenges, we propose a time-aware service ranking prediction approach named TSRPred for obtaining the global ranking from the collection of partial rankings. Specifically, a pairwise comparison model is constructed to describe the relationships between different services, where the partial rankings are obtained by time series forecasting on QoS values. The comparisons of IoT services are formulated by random walks, and thus, the global ranking can be obtained by sorting the steady-state probabilities of the underlying Markov chain. Finally, the efficacy of TSRPred is validated by simulation experiments based on large-scale real-world datasets.},

abstract = {It is well known that any kind of time series algorithm requires past information to model the inherent temporal relationship between past and future. This temporal dependency (i.e. number of past samples required for a good prediction) is generally addressed by feeding a number of past instances to the model in an empirical manner. Conventional approaches mostly rely on offline model, making them impractical to be adopted in the online or streaming context. Hence, a novel method of online temporality analysis is proposed in this paper. The estimated temporality is then employed to form an Adaptive Temporal Neural Network (ATNN) with an elastic memory capable of automatically selecting number of past samples to be used. Temporality change or drift can be a common occurrence in data streams. Hence a drift detection mechanism is also proposed. Once such drift is detected, a drift handling mechanism kicks in which utilizes the rate of drift, making our solution truly autonomous. The entire mechanism is termed as LEMON: Learning Elastic Memory Online. LEMON although not a time series model in itself, can work with any predictive models to improve their performance. Synthetic datasets are used here as proof of correct temporality estimation and drift detection whereas real world datasets are employed to demonstrate how LEMON improves the predictive performance and speed of an existing model with the knowledge of temporality and drift.},

However, there is a lack of effort on the development of new techniques for solving that problem and, therefore, achieving higher performance, which is important for the efficient management of energy in many levels. This study addresses this gap by proposing a new hybrid machine learning algorithm that incorporates the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system model with a new version of the firefly algorithm denominated as the gender-difference firefly algorithm. We expanded the search space diversification to increase the accuracy on the prediction and adopted the autoregressive process in order to approximate the chaotic behavior of the consumption time series.

Our results demonstrate the robustness and the accuracy of our proposal when compared to the traditional adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system models and also to the different predictive techniques implemented in several pieces of literature.},

abstract = {At an intersection with complex traffic flow, the early detection of the intention of drivers in surrounding vehicles can enable advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to warn the driver in advance or prompt its subsystems to assess the risk and intervene early. Although different drivers show various driving characteristics, the kinematic parameters of human‐driven vehicles can be used as a predictor for predicting the driver's intention within a short time. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid approach for vehicle behavior recognition at intersections based on time series prediction and deep learning networks. First, the lateral position, longitudinal position, speed, and acceleration of the vehicle are predicted using the online autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) algorithm. Next, a variant of the long short‐term memory network, called the bidirectional long short‐term memory (Bi‐LSTM) network, is used to detect the vehicle's turning behavior using the predicted parameters, as well as the derived parameters, i.e., the lateral velocity, lateral acceleration, and heading angle. The validity of the proposed method is verified at real intersections using the public driving data of the next generation simulation (NGSIM) project. The results of the turning behavior detection show that the proposed hybrid approach exhibits significant improvement over a conventional algorithm; the average recognition rates are 94.2% and 93.5% at 2 s and 1 s, respectively, before initiating the turning maneuver.},

abstract = {Random access is one of the most competitive multiple access schemes for future space-based Internet of Things (S-IoT) due to its support for massive connections and grant-free transmis-sion, as well as its ease of implementation. However, firstly, existing random access schemes are highly sensitive to load: once the load exceeds a certain critical value, the throughput will drop sharply due to the increased probability of data collision. Moreover, due to variable satellite coverage and bursty traffic, the network load of S-IoT changes dynamically; therefore, when existing random access schemes are applied directly to the S-IoT environment, the actual throughput is far below the theoretical maximum. Accordingly, this paper proposes an intelligent load control-based random access scheme based on CRDSA++, which is an enhanced version of the contention resolution diversity slotted ALOHA (CRDSA) and extends the CRDSA concept to more than two replicas. The proposed scheme is dubbed load control-based three-replica contention resolution diversity slotted ALOHA (LC-CRDSA3). LC-CRDSA3 actively controls network load. When the load threatens to exceed the critical value, only certain nodes are allowed to send data, and the load is controlled to be near the critical value, thereby effectively improving the throughput. In order to accurately carry out load con-trol, we innovatively propose a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)-based load estimation algo-rithm, which estimates the load value of each received frame by making full use of the number of time slots in different states. On this basis, LC-CRDSA3 adopts computational intelligence-based time series forecasting technology to predict the load values of future frames using the historical load values. We evaluated the performance of LC-CRDSA3 through a series of simulation experiments and compared it with CRDSA++. Our experimental results demonstrate that in S-IoT contexts where the load changes dynamically, LC-CRDSA3 can obtain network throughput that is close to the theoretical maximum across a wide load range through accurate load control.},

@article{Talkhi2021,
abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic conditions are still prevalent in Iran and other countries and the monitoring system is gradually discovering new cases every day. Therefore, it is a cause for concern around the world, and forecasting the number of future patients and death cases, although not entirely accurate, helps the governments and health-policy makers to make the necessary decisions and impose restrictions to reduce prevalence. Methods: In this study, we aimed to find the best model for forecasting the number of confirmed and death cases in Iran. For this purpose, we applied nine models including NNETAR, ARIMA, Hybrid, Holt-Winter, BSTS, TBATS, Prophet, MLP, and ELM network models. The quality of forecasting models is evaluated by three performance metrics, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. The best model is selected by the lowest value of performance metrics. Then, the number of confirmed and the death cases forecasted for the 30 next days. The used data in this study is the absolute number of confirmed, death cases from February 20 to August 15, 2020. Results: Our findings suggested that based on existing data in Iran, the suitable model with the lowest performance metrics for confirmed cases data obtained MLP network and the Holt-Winter model is the suitable model for forecasting death cases in the future. These models forecasted on September 14, 2020, we will have 2484 new confirmed and 114 new death cases of COVID-19. Conclusion: According to the results of this study and the existing data, we concluded that the MLP and Holt-Winter models had the lowest error in forecasting in comparison to other methods. Some models had fitted poorly in the test phase and this is because many other factors that are either not available or have been ignored in this study and can affect the accuracy of forecast results. Based on the trend of data and forecast results, the number of confirmed cases and death cases are almost constant and decreasing, respectively. However, due to disease progression and ignoring the recommendations and protocols of the Ministry of health, there is a possibility of re-emerging this disease more seriously in Iran and this requires more preventive care.},
