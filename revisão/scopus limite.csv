Demand forecast is usually designed for the seasonally changing load patterns. However, with the high penetration of EVs, daily charging demand makes traditional forecasting methods less accurate. This paper presents an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) method for demand forecasting of conventional electrical load (CEL) and charging demand of EV (CDE) parking lots simultaneously. Our EV charging demand prediction model takes daily driving patterns and distances as an input to determine the expected charging load profiles. The parameters of the ARIMA model are tuned so that the mean square error (MSE) of the forecaster is minimized. We improve the accuracy of ARIMA forecaster by optimizing the integrated and auto-regressive order parameters. Furthermore, due to the different seasonal and daily pattern of CEL and CDE, the proposed decoupled demand forecasting method provides significant improvement in terms of error reduction. The impact of EV charging demand on the accuracy of the proposed load forecaster is also analyzed in two approaches: (1) integrated forecaster for CEL + CDE, and (2) decoupled forecaster that targets CEL and CDE independently. The forecaster outputs are used to formulate a chance-constrained day-ahead scheduling problem. The numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed forecaster and its influence on the stochastic power system operation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA); Chance-constrained security-constrained unit commitment; Charging demand; Demand forecasting; Electric vehicle parking lots","Charging (batteries); Crashworthiness; Electric vehicles; Mean square error; Stochastic systems; Time series analysis; Vehicles; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Charging demands; Demand forecasting; Security constrained unit commitment; Vehicle parking; Forecasting",,,,,"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/11/18/fact-sheet-growing-united-states-electric-vehicle-market; Gellings, C.W., The Smart Grid: Enabling Energy Efficiency and Demand Response (2009), Fairmont Press; Rahmani-andebili, M., Venayagamoorthy, G.K., SmartPark placement and operation for improving system reliability and market participation (2015) Electr.

However, when it comes to time series forecasting, because of the inherent serial correlation and potential non-stationarity of the data, its application is not straightforward and often replaced by practitioners in favour of an out-of-sample (OOS) evaluation. It is shown that for purely autoregressive models, the use of standard K-fold CV is possible provided the models considered have uncorrelated errors. Such a setup occurs, for example, when the models nest a more appropriate model. This is very common when Machine Learning methods are used for prediction, and where CV can control for overfitting the data. Theoretical insights supporting these arguments are presented, along with a simulation study and a real-world example. It is shown empirically that K-fold CV performs favourably compared to both OOS evaluation and other time-series-specific techniques such as non-dependent cross-validation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Autoregression; Cross-validation; Time series","Forecasting; Learning systems; Regression analysis; Time series analysis; Auto regressive models; Autoregression; Autoregressive time series; Cross validation; K fold cross validations; Machine learning methods; Time series forecasting; Uncorrelated errors; Time series",,,,,"Andrews, D.W., Consistency in nonlinear econometric models: A generic uniform law of large numbers (1987) Econometrica, pp. 1465-1471; Arlot, S., Celisse, A., A survey of cross-validation procedures for model selection (2010) Stat.

Short-term forecasting covers a range of predictions from a fraction of an hour-ahead to a day-ahead forecasting. An accurate load forecast results in establishing appropriate operational practices and bidding strategies, as well as scheduling adequate energy transactions. This paper presents a generalized technique for modeling historical load data in the form of time-series with different cycles of seasonality (e.g., daily, weekly, quarterly, annually) in a given power network. The proposed method separately models both non-seasonal and seasonal cycles of the load data using auto-regressive (AR) and moving-average (MA) components, which only rely on historical load data without requiring any additional inputs such as historical weather data (which might not be available in most cases). The accuracy of data modeling is examined using the Akaike/Bayesian information criteria (AIC/BIC) which are two effective quantification methods for evaluation of data forecasting. In order to validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed forecaster, we use the hourly-metered load data of PJM network as a real-world input dataset. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Akaike information criterion; Autoregressive model; Bayesian information criterion; Electric power demand forecast; Moving-average model; Time-series forecasting","Electric power plant loads; Electric power systems; Electric power utilization; Time series; Time series analysis; Akaike information criterion; Auto regressive models; Bayesian information criterion; Electric power demands; Moving average model; Time series forecasting; Forecasting",,,,,"Gonzalez-Romera, E., Jaramillo-Moran, M.A., Carmona-Fernandez, D., Monthly electric energy demand forecasting based on trend extraction (2006) IEEE Trans.

However, complex and non-linear interdependencies between time steps and series complicate this task. To obtain accurate prediction, it is crucial to model long-term dependency in time series data, which can be achieved by recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with an attention mechanism. The typical attention mechanism reviews the information at each previous time step and selects relevant information to help generate the outputs; however, it fails to capture temporal patterns across multiple time steps. In this paper, we propose using a set of filters to extract time-invariant temporal patterns, similar to transforming time series data into its “frequency domain”. Then we propose a novel attention mechanism to select relevant time series, and use its frequency domain information for multivariate forecasting. We apply the proposed model on several real-world tasks and achieve state-of-the-art performance in almost all of cases.

Recently, the variational mode decomposition (VMD) has been proposed as an alternative to EMD to easily separate tones of similar frequencies in data where the EMD fails. The purpose of this study is to present a new time series forecasting model which integrates VMD and general regression neural network (GRNN). The performance of the proposed model is evaluated by comparing the forecasting results of VMD-GRNN with three competing prediction models; namely the EMD-GRNN model, feedforward neural networks (FFNN), and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) process on West Texas Intermediate (WTI), Canadian/US exchange rate (CANUS), US industrial production (IP) and the Chicago Board Options Exchange NASDAQ 100 Volatility Index (VIX) time series are used for experimentations. Based on mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and the root mean of squared errors (RMSE), the analysis results from forecasting demonstrate the superiority of the VMD-based method over the three competing prediction approaches. The practical analysis results suggest that VMD is an effective and promising technique for analysis and prediction of economic and financial time series. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Empirical mode decomposition; Forecasting; Neural network; Regression; Time series; Variational mode decomposition","Crude oil; Economic analysis; Errors; Feedforward neural networks; Finance; Financial data processing; Forecasting; Neural networks; Signal processing; Time series; Autoregressive moving average ARMA process; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Feedforward neural networks (FFNN); General regression neural network; Mean absolute percentage error; Mode decomposition; Regression; Time series forecasting models; Time series analysis",,,,,"Ai, L., Wang, J., Yao, R., Classification of parkinsonian and essential tremor using empirical mode decomposition and support vector machine (2011) Digital Signal Processing, 21, pp. 543-550; An, N., Zhao, W., Wang, J., Shang, D., Zhao, E., Using multi-output feedforward neural network with empirical mode decomposition based signal filtering for electricity demand forecasting (2013) Energy, 49, pp. 279-288; Cheng, C.-H., Wei, L.-Y., A novel time-series model based on empirical mode decomposition for forecasting TAIEX (2014) Economic Modeling, 36, pp. 136-141; Cheng, J., Yang, Y., Yang, Y., A rotating machinery fault diagnosis method based on local mean decomposition (2012) Digital Signal Processing, 22, pp. 356-366; Dragomiretskiy, K., Zosso, D., Variational mode decomposition (2014) IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 62, pp. 531-544; Haykin, S.O., (2008) Neural Networks and Learning Machines, , 3rd Prentice Hall Upper Saddle River, New Jersey; Huang, N.E., Shen, Z., Long, S.R., Wu, M.C., Shih, H.H., Zheng, Q., Yen, N.-C., Liu, H.H., The empirical mode decomposition and the Hilbert spectrum for non-linear and non-stationary time series analysis,"" (1998) Proc.

They consist of a randomly recurrent neuronal infra-structure called reservoir. Coming up with a good reservoir depends mainly on picking up the right parameters for the network initialization. Human expertise as well as repeatedly tests may sometimes provide acceptable parameters. Nevertheless, they are non-guaranteed. On the other hand, optimization techniques based on evolutionary learning have proven their strong effectiveness in unscrambling optimal solutions in complex spaces. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is one of the most popular continuous evolutionary algorithms. Throughout this paper, a PSO algorithm is associated to ESN to pre-train some fixed weights values within the network. Once the network's initial parameters are set, some untrained weights are selected for optimization. The new weights, already optimized, are re-squirted to the network which launches its normal training process. The performances of the network are a subject of the error and the time processing evaluation metrics. The testing results after PSO pre-training are compared to those of ESN without optimization and other existent approaches. The conceived approach is tested for time series prediction purpose on a set of benchmarks and real-life datasets. Experimental results show obvious enhancement of ESN learning results. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Echo State Network; Evolutionary learning; Particle swarm optimization; Pre-training; Reservoir; Time series prediction","Complex networks; Evolutionary algorithms; Forecasting; Optimization; Reservoirs (water); Time series; Time series analysis; Echo state networks; Evaluation metrics; Evolutionary Learning; Network initialization; Optimization techniques; Pre-training; Time series forecasting; Time series prediction; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)",,,,,"Saad, E., Prokhorov, D., Wunsch, D., Comparative study of stock trend prediction using time delay, recurrent and probabilistic neural networks (2002) IEEE Trans.

Accordingly, in the proposed method, multivariate time series data which include hourly load data, hourly temperature time series and fuzzified version of load time series, was converted into multi-channel images to be fed to a proposed deep learning CNN model with proper architecture. By using images which have been created from the sequenced values of multivariate time series, the proposed CNN model could determine and extract related important parameters, in an implicit and automatic way, without any need for human interaction and expert knowledge, and all by itself. By following this strategy, it was shown how employing the proposed method is easier than some traditional STLF models. Therefore it could be seen as one of the big difference between the proposed method and some state-of-the-art methodologies of STLF. Moreover, using fuzzy logic had great contribution to control over-fitting by expressing one dimension of time series by a fuzzy space, in a spectrum, and a shadow instead of presenting it with exact numbers. Various experiments on test data-sets support the efficiency of the proposed method. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Multivariate time series; Short term load forecasting;

Making accurate forecasting is critical for many decision makers. Various time series forecasting methods exist that use linear and nonlinear models separately or combination of both. Studies show that combining of linear and nonlinear models can be effective to improve forecasting performance. However, some assumptions that those existing methods make, might restrict their performance in certain situations. We provide a new Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)-Artificial Neural Network (ANN) hybrid method that work in a more general framework. Experimental results show that strategies for decomposing the original data and for combining linear and nonlinear models throughout the hybridization process are key factors in the forecasting performance of the methods. By using these findings, the proposed hybrid method is combined with Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) technique which generates more predictable components. We show that our hybrid method with EMD can be an effective way to improve forecasting accuracy obtained by traditional hybrid methods and also any of the individual methods that we used separately. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","ANN; ARIMA; EMD; Hybrid methods; Time series forecasting","Decision making; Neural networks; Nonlinear systems; Signal processing; Time series; ARIMA; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Forecasting performance; Hybrid method; Hybridization process; Linear and nonlinear models; Time series forecasting; Forecasting; Article; artificial neural network; conceptual framework; data analysis; data processing; forecasting; hybridization; linear system; measurement accuracy; nonlinear system; priority journal; time series analysis",,,,,"Brocklebank, J.C., Dickey, D.A., Choi, B., SAS for Forecasting Time Series (2018), 3rd Ed.

However, wind energy forecasting is still a challenging task owing to its inherent features of non-linearity and randomness. Therefore, this study develops a hybrid wind energy forecasting and analysis system including a deterministic forecasting module and an uncertainty analysis module to mitigate the challenges in existing studies. In particular, these challenges are as follows: (1) It is difficult to guarantee that the data characteristics underlying the time series are effectively extracted; (2) in the modeling of each subseries, i.e., when the original data is decomposed into some time series, forecasting accuracy and stability are not simultaneously considered, and thus, they are not properly modeled; and (3) the best function to perform a deterministic forecasting and uncertainty analysis based on the forecaster of each subseries is unknown. The developed hybrid system consists of three steps: First, data preprocessing is conducted to capture and mine the main feature of the wind energy time series and weaken the noises’ negative effects; second, multi-objective optimization is proposed to achieve the forecasting of each subseries with improvements in accuracy and stability; finally, search for the best function, which obtains the deterministic forecasting and uncertainty analysis results using an optimized extreme learning machine based on different modeling objectives, is conducted. Experimental simulations are performed using data from three sites in a real wind farm, which indicate that the developed system has a better performance in engineering applications than that of other methods. Furthermore, this system could not only be used as an effective tool for wind energy deterministic forecasting and uncertainty analysis, but also for other engineering application areas in the future. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Deterministic forecasting; Hybrid system; Optimization; Uncertainty analysis; Wind energy","Forecasting; Hybrid systems; Learning systems; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Search engines; Time series; Time series analysis; Wind power; Data characteristics; Deterministic forecasting; Electricity generation; Engineering applications; Experimental simulations; Extreme learning machine; Forecasting accuracy; Modeling objectives; Uncertainty analysis",,,,,"Bludszuweit, H., Domínguez-Navarro, J.A., Llombart, A., Statistical analysis of wind power forecast error (2008) IEEE Trans.

The virus started from a single human being in China, is now increasing globally at a rate of 3% to 5% daily and has become a never ending process. Some studies even predict that the virus will stay with us forever. India being the second most populous country of the world, is also not saved, and the virus is spreading as a community level transmitter. Therefore, it become really important to analyse the possible impact of COVID-19 in India and forecast how it will behave in the days to come. In present work, prediction models based on genetic programming (GP) have been developed for confirmed cases (CC) and death cases (DC) across three most affected states namely Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi as well as whole India. The proposed prediction models are presented using explicit formula, and impotence of prediction variables are studied. Here, statistical parameters and metrics have been used for evaluated and validate the evolved models. From the results, it has been found that the proposed GEP-based models use simple linkage functions and are highly reliable for time series prediction of COVID-19 cases in India. © 2020","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Genetic programming; India; SARS-CoV-2; Time series forecasting","Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Viruses; Ending process; Explicit formula; Gujarat; Human being; Prediction model; Simple linkages; Statistical parameters; Time series prediction; Time series analysis",,,,,"Huang, C., Wang, Y., Li, X., Ren, L., Zhao, J., Hu, Y., Zhang, L., Gu, X., Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in wuhan (2020) China Lancet, 395, pp. 497-506; WHO, Statement regarding cluster of pneumonia cases in wuhan, china; (2020) World Health Organization: Geneva, Switzerland, , https://www.who.int/china/news/detail/09-01-2020-who-statementregarding-cluster-of-pneumonia-cases-in-wuhan-china, Available online: (accessed on 17 February 2020); WHO, Novel coronavirus–thailand (ex-china) (2020) World Health Organization: Geneva, Switzerland, , https://www.who.int/csr/don/14-january-2020-novel-coronavirus-thailand-ex-china/en, Available online: (accessed on 17 February 2020); WHO director-general's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 – 11 march 2020. 2020.

However, long-term forecasting is difficult, particularly for cases where the underlying models and parameters are complex and unknown. Neural networks can effectively process features in temporal units and are attractive for such purposes. Reservoir computing, in particular, can offer efficient temporal processing of recurrent neural networks with a low training cost, and is thus well suited to time-series analysis and forecasting tasks. Here, we report a reservoir computing hardware system based on dynamic tungsten oxide (WOx) memristors that can efficiently process temporal data. The internal short-term memory effects of the WOx memristors allow the memristor-based reservoir to nonlinearly map temporal inputs into reservoir states, where the projected features can be readily processed by a linear readout function. We use the system to experimentally demonstrate two standard benchmarking tasks: isolated spoken-digit recognition with partial inputs, and chaotic system forecasting. A high classification accuracy of 99.2% is obtained for spoken-digit recognition, and autonomous chaotic time-series forecasting has been demonstrated over the long term. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"Chaotic systems; Forecasting; Harmonic analysis; Memristors; Recurrent neural networks; Tungsten compounds; Chaotic time series; Classification accuracy; Digit recognition; Internal shorts; Long-term forecasting; Reservoir Computing; Temporal processing; Tungsten oxide; Time series analysis",,,,,"Hopfield, J.J., Neural networks and physical systems with emergent collective computational abilities (1982) Proc.

This study developed a novel time-series sliding window metaheuristic optimization-based machine learning system for predicting real-time building energy consumption data collected by a smart grid. The proposed system integrates a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model and metaheuristic firefly algorithm-based least squares support vector regression (MetaFA-LSSVR) model. Specifically, the proposed system fits the SARIMA model to linear data components in the first stage, and the MetaFA-LSSVR model captures nonlinear data components in the second stage. Real-time data retrieved from an experimental smart grid installed in a building were used to evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of the proposed system. A k-week sliding window approach is proposed for employing historical data as input for the novel time-series forecasting system. The prediction system yielded high and reliable accuracy rates in 1-day-ahead predictions of building energy consumption, with a total error rate of 1.181% and mean absolute error of 0.026 kW h. Notably, the system demonstrates an improved accuracy rate in the range of 36.8-113.2% relative to those of the linear forecasting model (i.e., SARIMA) and nonlinear forecasting models (i.e., LSSVR and MetaFA-LSSVR). Therefore, end users can further apply the forecasted information to enhance efficiency of energy usage in their buildings, especially during peak times. In particular, the system can potentially be scaled up for using big data framework to predict building energy consumption. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Building energy management; Energy consumption; Machine learning; Metaheuristic optimization; Pattern prediction; Smart grid data; Time-series technique","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Buildings; Electric power transmission networks; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Learning systems; Optimization; Time series; Building energy consumption; Building energy efficiency; Building energy managements; Least squares support vector regression; Meta-heuristic optimizations; Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving averages; Smart grid; Time series techniques; Smart power grids; algorithm; energy efficiency; energy use; error analysis; forecasting method; machine learning; optimization; prediction; time series analysis",,,,,"Yuan, J., Hu, Z., Low carbon electricity development in China - an IRSP perspective based on super smart grid (2011) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 15, pp. 2707-2713; (2003) United States Department of Energy; Crisostomi, E., Gallicchio, C., Micheli, A., Raugi, M., Tucci, M., Prediction of the Italian electricity price for smart grid applications (2015) Neurocomputing, 170, pp. 286-295; Di Santo, K.G., Kanashiro, E., Di Santo, S.G., Saidel, M.A., A review on smart grids and experiences in Brazil (2015) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 52, pp. 1072-1082; Soares, J., Fotouhi Ghazvini, M.A., Vale, Z., de Moura Oliveira, P.B., A multi-objective model for the day-ahead energy resource scheduling of a smart grid with high penetration of sensitive loads (2016) Appl Energy, 162, pp. 1074-1088; Colak, I., Fulli, G., Sagiroglu, S., Yesilbudak, M., Covrig, C.-F., Smart grid projects in Europe: current status, maturity and future scenarios (2015) Appl Energy, 152, pp. 58-70; (2010) IEC Smart Rrid Standardization Roadmap Edition 1.0.

Random forest is a machine learning algorithm implemented in time series forecasting; however, most of its forecasting properties have remained unexplored. Here we focus on assessing the performance of random forests in one-step forecasting using two large datasets of short time series with the aim to suggest an optimal set of predictor variables. Furthermore, we compare its performance to benchmarking methods. The first dataset is composed by 16,000 simulated time series from a variety of Autoregressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average (ARFIMA) models. The second dataset consists of 135 mean annual temperature time series. The highest predictive performance of RF is observed when using a low number of recent lagged predictor variables. This outcome could be useful in relevant future applications, with the prospect to achieve higher predictive accuracy. © 2017 by the authors.","ARFIMA; ARMA; Machine learning; One-step ahead forecasting; Random forests; Time series forecasting; Variable selection","Artificial intelligence; Benchmarking; Decision trees; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Time series; Time series analysis; ARFIMA; ARMA; Random forests; Time series forecasting; Variable selection; Forecasting",,,,,"Shmueli, G., To explain or to predict?

In addition, in a dynamic environment such as the stock market, the nonlinearity of the time series is pronounced, immediately affecting the efficacy of stock price forecasts. Thus, this paper proposes an intelligent time series prediction system that uses sliding-window metaheuristic optimization for the purpose of predicting the stock prices of Taiwan construction companies one step ahead. It may be of great interest to home brokers who do not possess sufficient knowledge to invest in such companies. The system has a graphical user interface and functions as a stand-alone application. The developed hybrid system exhibited outstanding prediction performance and it improves overall profit for investment performance. The proposed model is a promising predictive technique for highly nonlinear time series, whose patterns are difficult to capture by traditional models. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Construction company; data mining; machine learning (ML); prediction system; sliding window; stock price forecasting; swarm intelligence and metaheuristic optimization; time series","Commerce; Construction industry; Costs; Data mining; Financial markets; Forecasting; Graphical user interfaces; Hybrid systems; Investments; Learning systems; Optimization; Swarm intelligence; Time series; Construction companies; Meta-heuristic optimizations; Prediction systems; Sliding Window; Stock price forecasting; Time series analysis",,,,,"He, J.P., Cai, L., Cheng, P., Fan, J.L., Optimal investment for retail company in electricity market (2015) IEEE Trans.

The proposed method addresses the problem of establishing a common membership grade for the situation when multiple fuzzification methods are available to fuzzify time series data. An aggregation operator for aggregating hesitant information is also proposed in the study. The proposed method is implemented to forecast enrollment at University of Alabama and price of state bank of India (SBI) share at Bombay stock exchange (BSE), India. In both time series data are fuzzified with triangular fuzzy sets constructed using intervals of equal and unequal length. The performance of the proposed method in forecasting student enrollments and SBI share price is measured in terms of root mean square and average forecasting errors. Statistical validation and performance analysis is also carried out to validate the proposed forecasting method. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Aggregation operator; Forecasting; Fuzzy logical relation; Fuzzy time series;

The Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) architecture provides a greener alternative with low energy consumption for mining big data, bringing the power of thousands of processing cores into a single chip, thus opening a wide range of possible applications. In this paper (a substantial extension of the short version presented at REM2016 on April 19–21, Maldives [1]), we design a novel parallel strategy for time series learning, in which different parts of the time series are evaluated by different threads. The proposed strategy is inserted inside the core a hybrid metaheuristic model, applied for learning patterns from an important mini/microgrid forecasting problem, the household electricity demand forecasting. The future smart cities will surely rely on distributed energy generation, in which citizens should be aware about how to manage and control their own resources. In this sense, energy disaggregation research will be part of several typical and useful microgrid applications.

Engineering and Information Technology, Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology, Burla, Odisha  768018, India","Over the past few decades, a large literature has evolved to forecast time series using various linear, nonlinear and hybrid linear–nonlinear models. Recently, hybrid models by suitably combining linear models like autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) with nonlinear models like artificial neural network (ANN) have become popular due to superior performance than individual models. These models assume the time series to be a sum of a linear and a nonlinear component. However, a real world time series may be purely linear or purely nonlinear or often contains a combination of linear and nonlinear patterns. Motivated by this need, a new hybrid methodology is developed by combining linear and nonlinear exponential smoothing models from innovation state space (ETS) with ANN. The proposed hybrid ETS–ANN model glorifies the chances of capturing different combination of linear and/or nonlinear patterns in time series. This is because both ETS and ANN models have linear as well as nonlinear modeling capability. However, ANN cannot handle linear patterns equally well as nonlinear patterns. Therefore, in the proposed method, first ETS is applied to the given time series and predictions are obtained. This enhances the chances of capturing existing linear patterns (if any) well using linear ETS models. Then residual error sequence is calculated by subtracting the ETS-predictions from the original series. The residual error sequence obtained is modeled by ANN. Then final prediction is obtained by combining the ETS-predictions with ANN-predictions. Sixteen time series datasets are used for comparative performance analysis of the proposed methodology with ARIMA, ETS, multilayer perceptron(MLP) and some existing hybrid ARIMA–ANN models. Experimental results show that the proposed hybrid model shows statistically promising result for the datasets used. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","ANN; ETS; Exponential smoothing; Hybrid model; Time series forecasting","Forecasting; Neural networks; Nonlinear systems; Time series; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Comparative performance analysis; Exponential smoothing; Exponential smoothing model; Hybrid model; Multi layer perceptron; Real-world time series; Time series forecasting; Time series analysis",,,,,"Babu, C.N., Reddy, B.E., A moving-average filter based hybrid ARIMA-ANN model for forecasting time series data (2014) Appl.

In this paper, we firstly propose a novel temporal attention encoder–decoder model to deal with the multivariate time series forecasting problem. It is an end-to-end deep learning structure that integrates the traditional encode context vector and temporal attention vector for jointly temporal representation learning, which is based on bi-directional long short-term memory networks (Bi-LSTM) layers with temporal attention mechanism as the encoder network to adaptively learning long-term dependency and hidden correlation features of multivariate temporal data. Extensive experimental results on five typical multivariate time series datasets showed that our model has the best forecasting performance compared with baseline methods. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Deep learning; Encoder–decoder; Long short-term memory networks; Multi-step forecasting; Multivariate time series; Temporal attention","Air quality; Brain; Decoding; Deep learning; Forecasting; Intrusion detection; Signal encoding; Time series; Air quality forecasting; Forecasting performance; Multi-step forecasting; Multivariate time series; Short term memory; Temporal attention; Temporal representations; Time series forecasting; Long short-term memory; article; attention; deep learning; forecasting; long short term memory network; time series analysis",,,,,"De Gooijer, J.G., Hyndman, R.J., 25 years of time series forecasting (2006) Int.

We highlight advantages and limitations of each method and discuss their implementation for parallel computing architectures. We quantify the relative prediction accuracy of these algorithms for the long-term forecasting of chaotic systems using as benchmarks the Lorenz-96 and the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky (KS) equations. We find that, when the full state dynamics are available for training, RC outperforms BPTT approaches in terms of predictive performance and in capturing of the long-term statistics, while at the same time requiring much less training time. However, in the case of reduced order data, large scale RC models can be unstable and more likely than the BPTT algorithms to diverge. In contrast, RNNs trained via BPTT show superior forecasting abilities and capture well the dynamics of reduced order systems. Furthermore, the present study quantifies for the first time the Lyapunov Spectrum of the KS equation with BPTT, achieving similar accuracy as RC. This study establishes that RNNs are a potent computational framework for the learning and forecasting of complex spatiotemporal systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Complex systems; Kuramoto–Sivashinsky; Lorenz-96; Reservoir Computing; RNN, LSTM, GRU; Time series forecasting","Backpropagation; Chaotic systems; Complex networks; Dynamics; Forecasting; Large scale systems; Network architecture; Parallel architectures; Backpropagation through time; Computational framework; Lorenz-96; Parallel computing architecture; Reservoir Computing; RNN, LSTM, GRU; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Time series forecasting; Long short-term memory; article; back propagation; chaotic dynamics; forecasting; learning; long short term memory network; prediction; time series analysis; algorithm; factual database; forecasting; human; machine learning; time factor; Algorithms; Databases, Factual; Forecasting; Humans; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Time Factors",,,,,"Abadi, M., Barham, P., Chen, J., Chen, Z., Davis, A., Dean, J., Tensorflow: A system for large-scale machine learning (2016) 12th USENIX symposium on operating systems design and implementation, pp. 265-283. , https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi16/osdi16-abadi.pdf, URL:; Abarbanel, H., Analysis of observed chaotic data (2012), Springer Science & Business Media; Aksamit, N.O., Sapsis, T.P., Haller, G., Machine-learning ocean dynamics from Lagrangian drifter trajectories (2019), arXiv preprint; Antonik, P., Haelterman, M., Massar, S., Brain-inspired photonic signal processor for generating periodic patterns and emulating chaotic systems (2017) Physical Review Applied, 7. , https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.7.054014, URL:; Arjovsky, M., Shah, A., Bengio, Y., Unitary evolution recurrent neural networks (2016) Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on international conference on machine learning, 48, pp. 1120-1128. , http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3045390.3045509, JMLR.org URL:; Belkin, M., Hsu, D., Ma, S., Mandal, S., Reconciling modern machine-learning practice and the classical bias–variance trade-off (2019) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 116, pp. 15849-15854; Bengio, Y., Simard, P., Frasconi, P., Learning long-term dependencies with gradient descent is difficult (1994) IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 5, pp. 157-166; Bianchi, F.M., Maiorino, E., Kampffmeyer, M.C., Rizzi, A., Jenssen, R., An overview and comparative analysis of recurrent neural networks for short term load forecasting (2017) CoRR, abs/1705.04378. , URL:; Bradley, E., Kantz, H., Nonlinear time-series analysis revisited (2015) Chaos.

Forecasting (or prediction), similarly to other data mining tasks, uses empirical evidence to select the most suitable model for a problem at hand since no modeling method can be considered as the best. However, according to our systematic literature review of the last decade, few scientific publications rigorously expose the benefits and limitations of the most popular algorithms for time series prediction. At the same time, there is a limited performance record of these models when applied to complex and highly nonlinear data. In this paper, we present one of the most extensive, impartial and comprehensible experimental evaluations ever done in the time series prediction field. From 95 datasets, we evaluate eleven predictors, seven parametric and four non-parametric, employing two multi-step-ahead projection strategies and four performance evaluation measures. We report many lessons learned and recommendations concerning the advantages, drawbacks, and the best conditions for the use of each model. The results show that SARIMA is the only statistical method able to outperform, but without a statistical difference, the following machine learning algorithms: ANN, SVM, and kNN-TSPI. However, such forecasting accuracy comes at the expense of a larger number of parameters. The evaluated datasets, as well detailed results achieved by different indexes as MSE, Theil's U coefficient, POCID, and a recently-proposed multi-criteria performance measure are available online in our repository. Such repository is another contribution of this paper since other researchers can replicate our results and evaluate their methods more rigorously. The findings of this study will impact further research on this topic since they provide a broad insight into models selection, parameters setting, evaluation measures, and experimental setup. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Automatic parameter tuning; Data mining; Multi-step-ahead prediction; Time series forecasting; Univariate analysis","Data mining; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Time series; Time series analysis; Automatic parameter tuning; Experimental evaluation; Machine learning models; Multi-step-ahead predictions; Statistical differences; Systematic literature review; Time series forecasting; Univariate analysis; Parameter estimation",,,,,"Ahmed, N.K., Atiya, A.F., Gayar, N.E., El-Shishiny, H., An empirical comparison of machine learning models for time series forecasting (2010) Econ.

Forecasting the energy consumption in buildings is essential for improving energy efficiency and sustainable development, and thereby reducing energy costs and environmental impact. This investigation presents a comprehensive review of machine learning (ML) techniques for forecasting energy consumption time series using actual data. Real-time data were collected from a smart grid that was installed in an experimental building and used to evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of statistical and ML techniques. Well-known artificial intelligence techniques were used to analyze energy consumption in single and ensemble scenarios. An in-depth review and analysis of the ‘hybrid model’ that combines forecasting and optimization techniques is presented. The comprehensive comparison demonstrates that the hybrid model is more accurate than the single and ensemble models. Both the accuracy of prediction and the suitability for use of these models are considered to support users in planning energy management. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Energy consumption;

In addition, there are other strategies; some of them combine aspects of both aforementioned concepts. In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation into the bias and variance behavior of multistep-ahead forecasting strategies. We provide a detailed review of the different multistep-ahead strategies. Subsequently, we perform a theoretical study that derives the bias and variance for a number of forecasting strategies. Finally, we conduct a Monte Carlo experimental study that compares and evaluates the bias and variance performance of the different strategies. From the theoretical and the simulation studies, we analyze the effect of different factors, such as the forecast horizon and the time series length, on the bias and variance components, and on the different multistep-ahead strategies. Several lessons are learned, and recommendations are given concerning the advantages, disadvantages, and best conditions of use of each strategy. © 2015 IEEE.","Bias; machine learning; Monte Carlo simulation; multistep-ahead forecasting; nearest neighbors; neural networks (NNs); time series; variance","Forecasting; Time series; Ahead-time; Bias and variance; Multi-step; Simulation studies; Theoretical study; Time series analysis",,,,,"Gooijer, J.G.D., Hyndman, R.J., 25 years of time series forecasting (2006) Int.

The datasets variability is evaluated using the mean absolute log return value. The models were compared in term of normalized root mean square error, mean absolute error and skill score. The most efficient models are selected for each variability and temporal horizon: for the weak variability, auto-regressive moving average and multi-layer perceptron are the most efficient, for a medium variability, auto-regressive moving average and bagged regression tree are the best predictors and for a high one, only more complex methods can be used efficiently, bagged regression tree and the random forest approach. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","ANN; ARMA; Gaussian process; Machine learning; Regression tree; SVR; Time series forecasting; Variability","Artificial intelligence; Decision trees; Forestry; Irradiation; Learning systems; Mean square error; Regression analysis; Solar radiation; Time series analysis; ARMA; Gaussian Processes; Regression trees; Time series forecasting; Variability; Weather forecasting; artificial neural network; forecasting method; Gaussian method; irradiation; machine learning; numerical model; prediction; regression analysis; solar radiation; statistical analysis; time series analysis; weather; Ajaccio; Corse; Corse du Sud; France",,,,,"Diagne, M., David, M., Lauret, P., Boland, J., Schmutz, N., Review of solar irradiance forecasting methods and a proposition for small-scale insular grids (2013) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 27, pp. 65-76; Voyant, C., Notton, G., Kalogirou, S., Nivet, M.-L., Paoli, C., Motte, F., Machine learning methods for solar radiation forecasting: a review (2017) Renew Energy, 105, pp. 569-582; Voyant, C., Soubdhan, T., Lauret, P., David, M., Muselli, M., Statistical parameters as a means to a priori assess the accuracy of solar forecasting models (2015) Energy, 90 (1), pp. 671-679; Lauret, P., Voyant, C., Soubdhan, T., David, M., Poggi, P., A benchmarking of machine learning techniques for solar radiation forecasting in an insular context (2015) Sol Energy, 112, pp. 446-457; Boland, J., David, M., Lauret, P., Short term solar radiation forecasting: island versus continental sites (2016) Energy, 113, pp. 186-192; Voyant, C., Motte, F., Fouilloy, A., Notton, G., Paoli, C., Nivet, M.-L., Forecasting method for global radiation time series without training phase: comparison with other well-known prediction methodologies (2017) Energy, 120, pp. 199-208; Troncoso, A., Salcedo-Sanz, S., Casanova-Mateo, C., Riquelme, J.C., Prieto, L., Local models-based regression trees for very short-term wind speed prediction (2015) Renew Energy, 81, pp. 589-598; De'ath, G., Boosted trees for ecological modeling and prediction (2007) Ecology, 88, pp. 243-251; Breiman, L., Bagging predictors (1996) Mach Learn, 24, pp. 123-140; Breiman, L., Random forests (2001) Mach Learn, 45, pp. 5-32; Rasmussen, C.E., Gaussian processes in machine learning (2004) Adv.

However, its integration into electrical systems presents numerous challenges due to the variable nature of the wind. Therefore, to maintain an economical and reliable electricity supply, it is necessary to accurately predict wind generation. The Wind Power Prediction Tool (WPPT) has been proposed to solve this task using the power curve associated with a wind farm. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) model complex non-linear relationships without requiring explicit mathematical expressions that relate the variables involved. In particular, two types of RNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Echo State Network (ESN), have shown good results in time series forecasting. In this work, we present an LSTM+ESN architecture that combines the characteristics of both networks. An architecture similar to an ESN is proposed, but using LSTM blocks as units in the hidden layer. The training process of this network has two key stages: (i) the hidden layer is trained with a descending gradient method online using one epoch; (ii) the output layer is adjusted with a regularized regression. In particular, the case is proposed where Step (i) is used as a target for the input signal, in order to extract characteristics automatically as the autoencoder approach; and in the second stage (ii), a quantile regression is used in order to obtain a robust estimate of the expected target. The experimental results show that LSTM+ESN using the autoencoder and quantile regression outperforms the WPPT model in all global metrics used. © 2017 by the authors.","Data science; Echo state network; Long short-term memory; Recurrent neural networks; Time series; Wind power forecasting","Brain; Electric power generation; Gradient methods; Learning systems; Memory architecture; Network architecture; Recurrent neural networks; Regression analysis; Time series; Time series analysis; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Data science; Echo state networks; Mathematical expressions; Non-linear relationships; Recurrent neural network (RNNs); Time series forecasting; Wind power forecasting; Wind power predictions; Long short-term memory",,,,,"Chang, W.-Y., A literature review of wind forecasting methods (2014) J.

However, considering the large fluctuations in the concentration of pollutants, most previous studies have focused on enhancing accuracy, while few have addressed the stability and uncertainty analysis, which may lead to insufficient results. Therefore, a novel early warning system based on fuzzy time series was successfully developed that includes three modules: deterministic prediction module, uncertainty analysis module, and assessment module. In this system, a hybrid model combining the fuzzy time series forecasting technique and data reprocessing approaches was constructed to forecast the major air pollutants. Moreover, an uncertainty analysis was generated to further analyze and explore the uncertainties involved in future air quality forecasting. Finally, an assessment module proved the effectiveness of the developed model. The experimental results reveal that the proposed model outperforms the comparison models and baselines, and both the accuracy and the stability of the developed system are remarkable. Therefore, fuzzy logic is a better option in air quality forecasting and the developed system will be a useful tool for analyzing and monitoring air pollution. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Data preprocessing; Forecasting accuracy; Fuzzy time series; Hybrid pollutants forecasting model; Interval analysis","Air quality; Fuzzy logic; Pollution control; Pollution detection; Quality control; Time series; Time series analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Data preprocessing; Forecasting accuracy; Forecasting modeling; Fuzzy time series; Interval analysis; Forecasting",,,,,"Prasad, K., Gorai, A.K., Goyal, P., Development of ANFIS models for air quality forecasting and input optimization for reducing the computational cost and time (2016) Atmos.

A support vector regression (SVR) model is widely used forecasting and data processing, but the individual SVR cannot always satisfy the requirements of time series forecasting. In this paper, a hybrid v-SVR model is developed and combined with principal component analysis (PCA) and brain storm optimization (BSO) for stock price index forecasting. Correlation analysis and PCA are conducted initially to select the input variables of the v-SVR from 20 technical indicators, while the advanced BSO algorithm is used to search for optimal parameters of v-SVR. Case studies of the China Securities Index 300 (CSI300) and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange Component Index (SZSE Component Index) are examined as illustrative examples to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the developed hybrid forecast strategy. Numerical results indicate that the developed hybrid model is not only simple but also able to satisfactorily approximate the actual CSI300stock price index, and it can be an effective tool in stock market mining and analysis. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Brain storm optimization; Data pre-analysis; Forecasting validity; Stock price index; v-Support vector regression","Big data; Commerce; Costs; Data handling; Data mining; Financial markets; Forecasting; Optimization; Regression analysis; Storms; Time series; Time series analysis; Weather forecasting; Data pre-analysis; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Shenzhen stock exchanges; Stock price; Stock price forecasting; Support vector regression (SVR); Time series forecasting; V-support vector regressions; Principal component analysis",,,,,"Singh, P., Borah, B., Forecasting stock index price based on M-factors fuzzy time series and particle swarm optimization (2014) Int.

In the high-frequency trading, forecasting for trading purposes is even a more challenging task, since an automated inference system is required to be both accurate and fast. In this paper, we propose a neural network layer architecture that incorporates the idea of bilinear projection as well as an attention mechanism that enables the layer to detect and focus on crucial temporal information. The resulting network is highly interpretable, given its ability to highlight the importance and contribution of each temporal instance, thus allowing further analysis on the time instances of interest. Our experiments in a large-scale limit order book data set show that a two-hidden-layer network utilizing our proposed layer outperforms by a large margin all existing state-of-the-art results coming from much deeper architectures while requiring far fewer computations. © 2012 IEEE.","Bilinear projection; feedforward neural network; financial data analysis; temporal attention; time-series prediction","Commerce; Computer architecture; Correlation theory; Data handling; Data reduction; Data structures; Electronic trading; Feedforward neural networks; Finance; Forecasting; Information analysis; Mathematical models; Network architecture; Network layers; Neural networks; Stochastic systems; Time series; Bilinear projection; Computational model; Financial Data Analysis; temporal attention; Time series prediction; Time series analysis",,,,,"Graves, A., Mohamed, A.-R., Hinton, G., Speech recognition with deep recurrent neural networks (2013) Proc.

To predict the price indices of stock markets, we developed an architecture which combined Elman recurrent neural networks with stochastic time effective function. By analyzing the proposed model with the linear regression, complexity invariant distance (CID), and multiscale CID (MCID) analysis methods and taking the model compared with different models such as the backpropagation neural network (BPNN), the stochastic time effective neural network (STNN), and the Elman recurrent neural network (ERNN), the empirical results show that the proposed neural network displays the best performance among these neural networks in financial time series forecasting. Further, the empirical research is performed in testing the predictive effects of SSE, TWSE, KOSPI, and Nikkei225 with the established model, and the corresponding statistical comparisons of the above market indices are also exhibited. The experimental results show that this approach gives good performance in predicting the values from the stock market indices. © 2016 Jie Wang et al.",,"Commerce; Electronic trading; Financial markets;

Various models have been developed to forecast building energy consumption. However, given buildings have different characteristics and operating conditions, model performance varies. Existing research has mainly taken a trial-and-error approach by developing multiple models and identifying the best performer for a specific building, or presumed one universal model form which is applied on different building cases. To the best of our knowledge, there does not exist a generalized system framework which can recommend appropriate models to forecast the building energy profiles based on building characteristics. To bridge this research gap, we propose a meta-learning based framework, termed Building Energy Model Recommendation System (BEMR). Based on the building's physical features as well as statistical and time series meta-features extracted from the operational data and energy consumption data, BEMR is able to identify the most appropriate load forecasting model for each unique building. Three sets of experiments on 48 test buildings and one real building were conducted. The first experiment was to test the accuracy of BEMR when the training data and testing data cover the same condition. BEMR correctly identified the best model on 90% of the buildings. The second experiment was to test the robustness of the BEMR when the testing data is only partially covered by the training data. BEMR correctly identified the best model on 83% of the buildings. The third experiment uses a real building case to validate the proposed framework and the result shows promising applicability and extensibility. The experimental results show that BEMR is capable of adapting to a wide variety of building types ranging from a restaurant to a large office, and gives excellent performance in terms of both modeling accuracy and computational efficiency. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Building energy consumption;

Each series is Box-Cox transformed, and decomposed by Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL); then bootstrapping is applied on the remainder series before the trend and seasonality are added back, and the transformation reversed to create bootstrapped versions of the series. Subsequently, they apply automatic exponential smoothing on the original series and the bootstrapped versions of the series, with the final forecast being the equal-weight combination across all forecasts. In this study we attempt to address the question: why does bagging for time series forecasting work? We assume three sources of uncertainty (model uncertainty, data uncertainty, and parameter uncertainty) and we separately explore the benefits of bagging for time series forecasting for each one of them. Our analysis considers 4004 time series (from the M- and M3-competitions) and two families of models. The results show that the benefits of bagging predominantly originate from the model uncertainty: the fact that different models might be selected as optimal for the bootstrapped series. As such, a suitable weighted combination of the most suitable models should be preferred to selecting a single model. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Aggregation; Bootstrapping; Forecasting; Model combination; Uncertainty","Agglomeration; Forecasting; Statistical methods; Time series; Uncertainty analysis; Bootstrapping; Exponential smoothing; Model combination; Model uncertainties; Parameter uncertainty; Sources of uncertainty; Time series forecasting; Uncertainty; Time series analysis",,,,,"Ahmadi-Javid, A., Jalali, Z., Klassen, K.J., Outpatient appointment systems in healthcare: A review of optimization studies (2017) European Journal of Operational Research, 258 (1), pp. 3-34; Bergmeir, C., Hyndman, R.J., Benítez, J.M., Bagging exponential smoothing methods using STL decomposition and Box-Cox transformation (2016) International Journal of Forecasting, 32, pp. 303-312; Box, G.E.P., Cox, D.R., An analysis of transformations (1964) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B, 26 (2), pp. 211-252; Box, G.E.P., Draper, N.R., Empirical model-building and response surfaces (1987), John Wiley & Sons New York; Breiman, L., Bagging predictors (1996) Machine Learning, 24 (2), pp. 123-140; Bühlmann, P., Sieve bootstrap for time series (1997) Bernoulli, 3 (2), pp. 123-148; Cleveland, R.B., Cleveland, W.S., McRae, J.E., Terpenning, I., STL: A seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on loess (1990) Journal of Official Statistics, 6, pp. 3-73; Cleveland, W.S., Grosse, E., Shyu, W.M., Local regression models. statistical modelss (1992), S.

However, to improve the accuracy of forecasting the stock opening price is a challenging task, therefore in this paper, we propose a robust time series learning model for prediction of stock opening price. The proposed model consists of two parts, namely the emotional analysis model and the long short-term memory (LSTM) time series learning model. Firstly, we use an emotion classifier based on naïve Bayesian to analyze the data from forums. Secondly, we combine the emotional data obtained from the previous experiments together with the actual Behavior Data as the training data for the long short-term memory time series learning model. Finally, a satisfactory result can be obtained by training the neural network. Experimental results show that by treating the stock exchange data, Shanghai Composite index and emotional data as the input variables can greatly improve the prediction accuracy. As expected, an outstanding prediction performance has been obtained from proposed model as it outperforms traditional neural network. The proposed model is expected to be a promising method in the realm of stock opening price prediction where the data are non-linear, long-term dependent and influenced by noise and many other factors. © 2017, International Association of Engineers.

One of these shortcomings is the selection of the final neural network model to be used to evaluate its performance in test set among many neural networks. The general way to overcome this problem is to divide data sets into training, validation, and test sets and also to select a neural network model that provides the smallest error value in the validation set. However, it is likely that the selected neural network model would be overfitting the validation data. This paper proposes a new model selection strategy (IHTS) for forecasting with neural networks. The proposed selection strategy first determines the numbers of input and hidden units, and then, selects a neural network model from various trials caused by different initial weights by considering validation and training performances of each neural network model. It is observed that the proposed selection strategy improves the performance of the neural networks statistically as compared with the classic model selection method in the simulated and real data sets. Also, it exhibits some robustness against the size of the validation data. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..","Forecasting; Model selection; Neural networks; Time series","Forecasting; Neural networks; Classic models; Error values; Initial weights; Model Selection; Neural network model; Real data sets; Time series forecasting; Validation data; Time series; Article; artificial neural network; comparative study; controlled study; data base; data processing; forecasting; Input Hidden and Trial Selection method; priority journal; statistical analysis; statistical significance; time series analysis; validation study",,,,,"De Gooijer, J.G., Kumar, K., Some recent developments in non-linear time series modelling, testing, and forecasting (1992) Int.

The framework can be applied to estimate probability density under both parametric and non-parametric settings. More specifically, stacked residual blocks based on dilated causal convolutional nets are constructed to capture the temporal dependencies of the series. Combined with representation learning, our approach is able to learn complex patterns such as seasonality, holiday effects within and across series, and to leverage those patterns for more accurate forecasts, especially when historical data is sparse or unavailable. Extensive empirical studies are performed on several real-world datasets, including datasets from JD.com, China's largest online retailer. The results show that our framework compares favorably to the state-of-the-art in both point and probabilistic forecasting. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Convolutional neural network; Demand forecasting; Dilated causal convolution; High-dimensional time series; Probabilistic forecasting","Convolution; Forecasting; Time series; Causal convolutions; Demand forecasting; Empirical studies; High-dimensional; Probabilistic forecasting; Probability densities; Real-world datasets; Time series forecasting; Convolutional neural networks; article; China; convolutional neural network; empiricism; feature learning (machine learning); forecasting; seasonal variation; time series analysis",,,,,"Bai, S., Kolter, J.Z., Koltun, V., (2018), An Empirical Evaluation of Generic Convolutional and Recurrent Networks for Sequence Modeling; Bandara, K., Bergmeir, C., Smyl, S., Forecasting across time series databases using recurrent neural networks on groups of similar series: a clustering approach (2020) Expert Syst.

Despite many advanced methodologies have been proposed, modelling the underlying relationship between past and future conditions is still a challenge. In this research, we develop a novel time series forecasting model which can effectively predict future conditions in a timely fashion. A time series has nonlinear and nonstationary characteristics which make prediction using statistical or computational intelligent methods a difficult task. Therefore, a hybrid deep learning and empirical mode decomposition model, namely EMD–SAE, for multistep ahead forecasting is proposed to predict the traffic flow and random time series. The performances of the proposed model are compared and discussed. This paper shows the potential of hybridizing the deep learning and empirical mode decomposition to the ordinary time series forecasting approach, and the experimental results suggest that the proposed EMD–SAE is reliable, suitable and a promising method for time series forecasting. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Deep learning;

Many time series contain periods, e.g. seasonal changes in weather time series or electricity usage at day and night time. Here, we first analyze the behavior of RNNs with an attention mechanism with respect to periods in time series and illustrate that they fail to model periods. Then, we propose an extended attention model for sequence-to-sequence RNNs designed to capture periods in time series with or without missing values. This extended attention model can be deployed on top of any RNN, and is shown to yield state-of-the-art performance for time series forecasting on several univariate and multivariate time series. © 2018","Attention model; Recurrent neural networks; Time series","Recurrent neural networks; Time series; Attention mechanisms; Attention model; Electricity usage; Multivariate time series; Recurrent neural network (RNNs); Seasonal changes; Sequence modeling; Time series forecasting; Time series analysis; Article; artificial neural network; forecasting; multivariate analysis; prediction; priority journal; recurrent neural network; statistical model; time series analysis; univariate analysis",,,,,"De Gooijer, J.G., Hyndman, R.J., 25 years of time series forecasting (2006) Int.

In the first-stage, an evolutionary FCM is constructed automatically from historical time series data using the previously proposed structure optimization genetic algorithm, while in the second stage, the produced FCM defines the inputs in an ANN which next is trained by the back propagation method with momentum and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm on the basis of available data. The structure optimization genetic algorithm for automatic construction of FCM is implemented for modeling complexity based on historical time series data, selecting the most important nodes (attributes) and interconnections among them thus providing a less complex and efficient FCM-based model. This model is used next as input in an ANN. ANNs are used at the final process for making time series prediction considering as inputs the concepts defined by the produced FCM. The previously proposed structure optimization genetic algorithm for FCM construction by historical data as well as the ANN have been already proved their efficacy on time series forecasting. The performance of the proposed approach is presented through the analysis of multivariate historical data of benchmark datasets for making predictions. The multivariate analysis of historical data is held for a large number of input variables, like season, month, day or week, holiday, mean and high temperature, etc. The whole approach was implemented in an intelligent software tool initially deployed for FCM prediction. Through the experimental analysis, the usefulness of the new two-stage approach in time series prediction is demonstrated, by calculating seven prediction performance indicators which are well known from the literature. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial neural network; Forecasting; Fuzzy cognitive map; Real coded genetic algorithm; Time series prediction","Backpropagation; Backpropagation algorithms; Benchmarking; Cognitive systems; Complex networks; Evolutionary algorithms; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy rules; Fuzzy systems; Genetic algorithms; Large scale systems; Multivariant analysis; Neural networks; Optimization; Shape optimization; Structural optimization; Time series; Fuzzy cognitive map; Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs); Intelligent software tools; Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm; Multivariate time series; Real coded genetic algorithm; Time series forecasting; Time series prediction; Time series analysis; algorithm; Article; artificial neural network; automation; calculation; controlled study; data analysis; fuzzy cognitive map; fuzzy system; high temperature; history; Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm; mathematical model; prediction; quality control; season; software; structure optimization algorithm; time series analysis; two stage model",,,,,"Ahmadi, S., Forouzideh, N., Alizadeh, S., Papageorgiou, E.I., Learning fuzzy cognitive maps using imperialist competitive algorithm (2015) Neural Comput.

However, the task of time series forecasting is very challenging because it is affected by many complex factors. For example, in predicting traffic and solar power generation, weather can bring great trouble. In particular, for strictly periodic time series, if the periodic information can be extracted from the historical sequence data to the maximum, the accuracy of the prediction will be greatly improved. At present, for time series prediction tasks, the sequence models based on RNN have made great progress. However, the sequence models has difficulty in capturing global information, failing to well highlight the periodic characteristics of the time series. But the this problem can be solved by CNN models. So in this paper, we propose a model called Multiple CNNs to solve the problem of periodic multivariate time series prediction. The working process of Multiple CNNs is analyzing the periodicity of time series, extracting the closeness and the long and short periodic information of the predicted target respectively, and finally integrating the characteristics of the three parts to make the prediction. Moreover, the model is highly flexible, which allows users to freely adjust the cycle span set in the model according to their own data characteristics. Tests on two large real-world datasets, show that our model has a strong advantage over other time series prediction methods. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Convolutional neural network; Multivariate time series prediction; Periodic; Periodic feature","Convolution; Forecasting; Large dataset; Learning systems; Neural networks; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Convolutional neural network; Data characteristics; Machine learning research; Multivariate time series; Periodic; Periodic feature; Time series forecasting; Time series prediction; Time series; article; human; human experiment; intimacy; periodicity; prediction; time series analysis",,,,,"Clark, S., Traffic prediction using multivariate nonparametric regression (2003) J.

Due to the exploding demands of mobile video streaming services, coupled with limited bandwidth availability, video streams are often transmitted through unreliable, low-bandwidth networks. This unavoidably leads to two types of major streaming-related impairments: compression artifacts and/or rebuffering events. In streaming video applications, the end-user is a human observer; hence being able to predict the subjective Quality of Experience (QoE) associated with streamed videos could lead to the creation of perceptually optimized resource allocation strategies driving higher quality video streaming services. We propose a variety of recurrent dynamic neural networks that conduct continuous-time subjective QoE prediction. By formulating the problem as one of time-series forecasting, we train a variety of recurrent neural networks and non-linear autoregressive models to predict QoE using several recently developed subjective QoE databases. These models combine multiple, diverse neural network inputs, such as predicted video quality scores, rebuffering measurements, and data related to memory and its effects on human behavioral responses, using them to predict QoE on video streams impaired by both compression artifacts and rebuffering events. Instead of finding a single time-series prediction model, we propose and evaluate ways of aggregating different models into a forecasting ensemble that delivers improved results with reduced forecasting variance. We also deploy appropriate new evaluation metrics for comparing time-series predictions in streaming applications. Our experimental results demonstrate improved prediction performance that approaches human performance.

Traditional forecasting methods such as the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and exponential smoothing (ETS) are employed to map linear patterns in a time series while neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVMs) map nonlinear patterns. A traditional hybrid ARIMA-ANN system works by performing linear relationships in the data, considering the residual error a nonlinear component which is mapped by the ANN. The nature of a time series can be taken into consideration before applying a model. This work employs both linear and nonlinear patterns of a time series based on its volatility. This is explored using a hybrid evolutionary system composed by a simple exponential smoothing filter, ARIMA and autoregressive (AR) linear models and a SVR model. Particle swarm optimization is employed to optimize the order of the AR model, SVR parameters and number of lags of the time series. Experimental results show that the evolutionary hybrid system presented promising results in the forecasting domain. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Hybrid intelligent systems; Time series forecasting","Evolutionary algorithms; Forecasting; Hybrid systems; Intelligent systems; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Support vector machines; Time series analysis; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Exponential smoothing; Hybrid evolutionary systems; Hybrid intelligent system; Linear and nonlinear models; Simple exponential smoothing; Support vector machine (SVMs); Time series forecasting; Time series; algorithm; Article; artificial neural network; forecasting; hybrid evolutionary decomposition system; mathematical analysis; prediction; priority journal; support vector machine; time series forecasting",,,,,"Box, G.E., Jenkins, G.M., Reinsel, G.C., (2013) Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control, , Wiley.com, New Jersey; Zhang, G., Eddy Patuwo, B., Hu, M.Y., Forecasting with artificial neural networks. the state of the art (1998) Int.

As wind variability is stochastic, Gaussian Process regression has recently been introduced to capture the randomness of wind energy. However, the disadvantages of Gaussian Process regression include its computation complexity and incapability to adapt to time varying time-series systems. A variant Gaussian Process for time series forecasting is introduced in this study to address these issues. This new method is shown to be capable of reducing computational complexity and increasing prediction accuracy. The convergence of the forecasting results is also proved. Further, a teaching learning based optimization (TLBO) method is used to train the model and to accelerate the learning rate. The proposed modelling and optimization method is applied to forecast both the wind power generation in Ireland and that from a single wind farm to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Gaussian Process; Model consistency; TLBO; Wind power forecasting","Electric power generation; Forecasting; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Stochastic systems; Time series; Wind power; Gaussian process regression; Gaussian Processes; Model consistency; Power system operation and controls; Teaching-learning-based optimizations; Time series forecasting; TLBO; Wind power forecasting; Weather forecasting; Article; forecasting; genetic algorithm; information processing; Ireland; machine learning; mathematical computing; particle swarm optimizaton; prediction; priority journal; regression analysis; teaching learning based optimization; time series analysis; variant Gaussian process; wind power",,,,,"Giebel, G., Brownsword, R., Kariniotakis, G., Denhard, M., Draxl, C., (2011) The State-of-the-art in Short-term Prediction of Wind Power: A Literature Overview, , Technical Report, ANEMOS, plus; Foley, A.M., Leahy, P.G., Marvuglia, A., McKeogh, E.J., Current methods and advances in forecasting of wind power generation (2012) Renew.

However, it still remains challenging to deal with large-scale nonstationary time series, which have trend and vary rapidly with time. In this paper, we propose a time-series prediction model based on the hybrid combination of high-order FCMs (HFCMs) with the redundant wavelet transform to handle large-scale nonstationary time series. The model is termed as Wavelet-HFCM. The redundant Haar wavelet transform is applied to decompose original nonstationary time series into multivariate time series; then, the HFCM is used to model and predict multivariate time series. In learning HFCMs to represent large-scale multivariate time series, a fast HFCM learning method is designed on the basis of ridge regression to reduce the learning time. Finally, summing multivariate time series up yields the predicted time series at each time step. Compared with existing classical methods, the experimental results on eight benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our proposal, indicating that our prediction model can be applied to various prediction tasks. © 1993-2012 IEEE.","Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs); high-order fuzzy cognitive maps (HFCMs); redundant Haar wavelet transform; time-series prediction","Cognitive systems; Forecasting; Fuzzy rules; Numerical models; Regression analysis; Wavelet transforms; Fuzzy cognitive map; Haar wavelet transform; Prediction algorithms; Predictive models; Time series prediction; Time series analysis",,,,,"Sugeno, M., (1985) Industrial Applications of Fuzzy Control, , Amsterdam, The Netherlands Elsevier; Vrkalovic, S., Teban, T.-A., Borlea, I.-D., Stable Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy control designed by optimization (2017) Int.

However, traditional time series forecasting models can not effectively extract good enough sequence data features and often result in poor forecasting accuracy. In this paper, a novel time series forecasting model, named SeriesNet, which can fully learn features of time series data in different interval lengths. The SeriesNet consists of two networks. The LSTM network aims to learn holistic features and to reduce dimensionality of multi-conditional data, and the dilated causal convolution network aims to learn different time interval. This model can learn multi-range and multi-level features from time series data, and has higher predictive accuracy compared those models using fixed time intervals. Moreover, this model adopts residual learning and batch normalization to improve generalization. Experimental results show our model has higher forecasting accuracy and has greater stableness on several typical time series datasets. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Deep learning; Dilated causal convolution; Long Short-Term Memory; Time series forecasting","Convolution; Deep learning; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Time series; Causal convolutions; Fixed time interval; Forecasting accuracy; Holistic features; Predictive accuracy; Time series forecasting; Time series forecasting models; Time-series data; Time series analysis; article; deep learning; forecasting; short term memory; time series analysis",,,,,"Cheng, C., Sa-Ngasoongsong, A., Beyca, O., Le, T., Yang, H., Kong, Z., Bukkapatnam, S.T., Time series forecasting for nonlinear and non-stationary processes: a review and comparative study (2015) IIE Trans., 47 (10), pp. 1053-1071; Akaike, H., Fitting autoregressive models for prediction (1969) Ann.

Fuzzy time series forecasting models do not need strict assumptions, whereas conventional stochastic models need to satisfy some assumptions. In addition, fuzzy time series methods can be used if the observations of time series have uncertainty. Fuzzy time series approaches comprise three basic steps: fuzzification of the crisp observations, identification of fuzzy relations, and defuzzification. In previous studies, many methods have been proposed that allow all of these stages to obtain more accurate forecasting results. One of the weakest features of fuzzy time series methods is that the membership values are not considered in the forecasting process. This problem can be eliminated in first order approaches by using artificial neural networks to describe fuzzy relations. When determining the fuzzy relations, the membership values are not ignored if the inputs and outputs of the neural networks are the membership values for the periods t − 1 and t, respectively. However, the number of inputs of neural networks will increase greatly if this approach is extended to high-order models. Thus, it will be very difficult to train these neural networks. In this study, we propose a novel high-order fuzzy time series approach that considers the membership values, where artificial neural networks are employed to identify the fuzzy relations. In the proposed method, intersection operators are utilized to deal with an excessive number of inputs. In addition, the fuzzy c-means method is employed for fuzzification. The forecasting performance was evaluated by applying the proposed method to well-known time series data sets and the results obtained were compared with those produced by previously described forecasting methods. The superior performance of our proposed method was also supported by a simulation study. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial neural network; Forecasting; Fuzzy C-means; High-order fuzzy time series; Intersection operation; Membership degree","Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Neural networks; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Crisp observations; Forecasting methods; Forecasting performance; Fuzzy C mean; Fuzzy C means method; Fuzzy time series; Intersection operation; Membership degrees; Time series analysis",,,,,"Zadeh, L.A., Fuzzy Sets (1965) Inf.

The key concept of this approach is: (1) A part of equilibrium path is traced by numerical analysis; (2) Data of this part is then used for training predictive network; (3) Applying the trained network, the rest of the equilibrium path is simply traced by pure prediction without using any analysis. As an illustration for ANP approach, the analysis package is in this study established based on isogeometric shell analysis using the first-order shear deformation shell theory (FSDT). As the main advantage of the proposed approach, computational cost is significantly lower than that of the conventional approach based on pure numerical analysis. In addition, the predictive networks are built via group method of data handling (GMDH) known as a self-organizing deep learning method for time series forecasting problems without requirement of big data. Some numerical examples are provided to confirm the high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach. The approach not only could be applied to a wide range of computational mechanics problems in which nonlinear response occurs but also to other computational engineering fields. © 2019","Geometrically nonlinear problems; Group method of data handling; Isogeometric shell analysis; Time series forecasting problems","Computation theory; Computational mechanics; Data handling; Deep learning; Experimental reactors; Forecasting; Numerical analysis; Time series; Time series analysis; Computational costs; Computational engineering; Conventional approach; First order shear deformation shell theories; Geometrically nonlinear problem; Group method of data handling; Shell analysis; Time series forecasting; Nonlinear analysis",,,,,"Rezaiee-Paj, M., Naserian, R., Geometrical nonlinear analysis based on optimization technique (2018) Appl.

This study has used the available data of key pollutants to predict their future status through time-series modelling. Most researchers have employed Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average and Logistic Regression techniques, and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System has rarely been used to analyse time-series data. Traditional time-series forecasting models assume a linear relationship between variables, while there are nonlinear and complex components in air pollution modelling. This study aimed to respond to this limitation by improving the accuracy of the daily prediction of pollutants via time-series data analysis by using Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System modelling. A nonlinear multivariate regression model was developed and experimentally refined to obtain the least error possible. Data on pollutants containing CO, SO2, O3, and NO2 are collected from a single monitoring point in Tehran. The process of the developing the model begins by breaking down the data sets into training, testing, and validation set at a random ratio of 80%, 10%, and 10%. For the prediction of CO, SO2, O3, and NO2, the coefficients of determination are calculated as 0.8686, 0.8011, 0.8350 and 0.7640, and these values for the semi-experimental model were 0.8445, 0.8001, 0.7830 and 0.7602. According to the performance indicators of both models, Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System is more accurate in predicting time-series data than regression models. Reliable forecasting of future air quality would help governments develop policies and regulations to protect humans and ecosystems and achieve sustainable development. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Air pollution prediction; Nonlinear regression; Semi-experimental model; Sustainable development; Time-series data","Air quality; Environmental protection; Forecasting; Fossil fuels; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Logistic regression; Nitrogen oxides; Planning; Pollution detection; Sustainable development; Time series; Time series analysis; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Air pollution predictions; Experimental modeling; Non-linear regression; Time-series data; Fuzzy inference",,,,,"Adiguzel, E., Ozer, E., Akgundogdu, A., Yilmaz, A.E., Prediction of dust particle size effect on efficiency of photovoltaic modules with ANFIS: an experimental study in Aegean region, Turkey (2019) Sol.

Here, a hybrid model using evolutionary extreme learning machine and variational mode decomposition (VMD) is developed to forecast annual runoff time series. In the proposed method, the VMD method is first used to decompose the original streamflow into a series of disjoint subcomponents; second, each subcomponent is forecasted by constructing an appropriate extreme learning machine model while the gravitational search algorithm is adopted to tune the model parameters; finally, the aggregated output generated by the forecasting results of all the models is treated as the final simulated output. The annual runoff data series of three huge hydropower reservoirs in China are chosen to testify the performance of the proposed forecasting model. The results show that the developed model can outperform several traditional methods with respect to the employed statistical indexes. Thus, the decomposition-ensemble idea is helpful to yield accurate and stable forecasting results, while the proposed forecasting method can provide strong technical support for operators in water resources and power systems. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Decomposition and ensemble; Evolutionary extreme learning machine; Gravitational search algorithm; Hydrological time series forecasting; Variational mode decomposition","Evolutionary algorithms; Forecasting; Knowledge acquisition; Learning algorithms; Reservoirs (water); Runoff; Stream flow; Time series; Annual runoff prediction; Extreme learning machine; Gravitational search algorithms; Hydrological time-series; Hydropower reservoirs; Mode decomposition; Time series prediction; Water resources planning and managements; Machine learning; annual variation; decomposition analysis; ensemble forecasting; hydrological modeling; machine learning; runoff; streamflow; time series analysis; China",,,,,"Abdoos, A.A., A new intelligent method based on combination of VMD and ELM for short term wind power forecasting (2016) Neurocomputing, 203 (AUG), pp. 111-120. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2016.03.054; Bai, T., Chang, J.X., Chang, F.J., Huang, Q., Wang, Y.M., Chen, G.S., Synergistic gains from the multi-objective optimal operation of cascade reservoirs in the Upper Yellow River basin (2015) J.

The artificial intelligence model is widely used in forecasting and data processing, but the individual back-propagation artificial neural network cannot always satisfy the time series forecasting needs. Thus, a hybrid forecasting approach has been proposed in this study, which consists of data preprocessing, parameter optimization and a neural network for advancing the accuracy of short-term wind speed forecasting. According to the case study, in which the data are collected from Peng Lai, a city located in China, the simulation results indicate that the hybrid forecasting method yields better predictions compared to the individual BP, which indicates that the hybrid method exhibits stronger forecasting ability. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI.","Artificial intelligence; Forecasting accuracy; Hybrid method; Neural network; Optimization algorithm; Short-term wind speed series forecasting","Artificial intelligence; Backpropagation; Big data; Data handling; Data mining; Neural networks; Optimization; Spectrum analysis; Time series; Time series analysis; Wind; Wind power; Back propagation artificial neural network (BPANN); Forecasting accuracy; Hybrid method; Optimization algorithms; Short-term wind speed forecasting; Singular spectrum analysis; Time series forecasting; Wind speed; Forecasting",,,,,"Wang, J.Z., Qin, S.S., Jin, S.Q., Wu, J., Estimation methods review and analysis of offshore extreme wind speeds and wind energy resources (2015) Renew.

This paper demonstrates how SST measurements can be combined with numerical estimations with the help of neural networks and how reliable site-specific forecasts can be made accordingly. Additionally, this work demonstrates the skill of a special wavelet neural network in this task. The study was conducted at six different locations in the Indian Ocean and over three time scales (daily, weekly, and monthly). At every time step, the difference between the numerical estimation and the SST measurement was evaluated, an error time series was formed, and errors over future time steps were forecasted. The time series forecasting was affected through neural networks. The predicted errors were added to the numerical estimation, and SST predictions were made over five time steps in the future. The performance of this procedure was assessed through various error statistics, which showed a highly satisfactory functioning of this scheme. The wavelet neural network based on the particular basic or mother wavelet called the ""Meyer wavelet with discrete approximation"" worked more satisfactorily than other wavelets. © 2016 American Meteorological Society.","Forecasting; Mathematical and statistical techniques; Neural networks; Numerical analysis/modeling; Operational forecasting; Time series","Atmospheric temperature; Error statistics; Errors; Estimation; Forecasting; Marine applications; Neural networks; Submarine geophysics; Surface properties; Surface waters; Time series; Time series analysis; Discrete approximation; Numerical analysis/modeling; Numerical estimation; Operational forecasting; Sea surface temperature (SST); Statistical techniques; Time series forecasting; Wavelet neural networks; Oceanography; artificial neural network; computer simulation; error analysis; numerical model; performance assessment; prediction; sea surface temperature; time series; weather forecasting; Indian Ocean",,,,,"Addison, P.S., (2002) The Illustrated Wavelet Transform Handbook: Introductory Theory and Applications in Science, Engineering, Medicine and Finance, p. 353. , Institute of Physics Publishing; Aguilar-Martinez, S., Hsieh, W.W., Forecasts of tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures by neural networks and support vector regression (2009) Int.

Forecasting is a challenging task in the area of Time Series Analysis. Forecasting has a great significance in decision-making in the area of economy, climatology, employment sector, agriculture, tourism, etc. Timely forecast helps to prevent loss from natural calamities. Fuzzy Time Series Forecasting is an emergent research area. It deals with the problems associated with uncertainty, vagueness and imprecision. Following the pioneering publications by Song and Schissom [148–150], a significant advancement of research has been observed in this direction. This paper summarizes and reviews past twenty five year's contribution in the area of Fuzzy time series forecasting. Due to large volume of publications in this field, we have only highlighted the papers published in different journals of Elsevier (or appeared online in ScienceDirect.com), during 1993-2018. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Inference; Interval; Optimization; Order; Partitioning; Seasonal","Decision making; Forecasting; Optimization; Inference; Interval; Order; Partitioning; Seasonal; Time series analysis",,,,,"Abdollahzade, M., Miranian, A., Hassani, H., Iranmanesh, H., A new hybrid enhanced local linear neuro-fuzzy model based on the optimized singular spectrum analysis and its application for nonlinear and chaotic time series forecasting (2015) Inf.

All of these stages play a very important role on the forecasting performance of the model. An important stage of the fuzzy time series analysis is to determine the fuzzy relationships. Artificial neural networks seem to be very effective in determining fuzzy relationships that improve the accuracy of the forecasting performance. Several neuron models with different characteristics have been proposed so far. One of these models is Pi-Sigma neural network. An important advantage of Pi-Sigma neural network is that it requires fewer weights and nodes and has a lower number of computations when compared to multilayer perceptron. In this study, a new model for determining the fuzzy relationships for high order fuzzy time series forecasting which uses Pi-Sigma neural network is introduced. A modified particle swarm optimization model is used to train the Pi-Sigma network. We test the new model on two real datasets and we also perform a simulation study. The results are compared to the ones obtained by other techniques and show a better performance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Fuzzy relations; Fuzzy time series; Particle swarm optimization; Pi-sigma neural network","Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Defuzzifications; Forecasting performance; Fuzzy relations; Fuzzy relationship; Fuzzy time series; Modified particle swarm optimization; Simulation studies; Time series method; Time series analysis",,,,,"Aladag, C.H., Using multiplicative neuron model to establish fuzzy logic relationships (2013) Expert Syst.

The presence of correlation (i.e. spatial correlation across several sites and time correlation within each site) poses difficulties with respect to traditional modeling, computation and statistical theory. This paper presents a cluster-centric forecasting methodology that allows us to yield a characterization of correlation in geophysical time series through a spatio-temporal clustering step. The clustering phase is designed for partitioning time series of numeric data routinely sampled at specific space locations. A forecasting model is then computed by resorting to multivariate time series analysis, in order to predict the future values of a time series by utilizing not only its own historical values, but also information from other cluster-time series. Experimental results highlight the importance of dealing with both temporal and spatial correlation and validate the proposed cluster-centric strategy in the computation of a multivariate time series forecasting model. © 2016","Multivariate time series analysis; Spatio-temporal clustering; Time series forecasting","Computation theory; Forecasting; Geophysics; Harmonic analysis; Forecasting modeling; Geophysical time series; Multiple time series; Multivariate time series; Multivariate time series analysis; Spatio-temporal clustering; Temporal and spatial correlation; Time series forecasting; Time series analysis",,,,,"Appice, A., Ciampi, A., Malerba, D., Summarizing numeric spatial data streams by trend cluster discovery (2015) Data Min.

A number of studies have shown that hybrid modelling is very successful in various modelling applications, and both theoretical and empirical findings have shown that hybrid modelling is an effective method to improve the accuracy of time series models. This paper proposes a hybrid model that combines a linear regression (LR) model and deep belief network (DBN) model for the prediction of time series data. In the hybrid model, the linear AR (auto-regression) LR model or ARIMA (auto-regressive integrated moving average) model and the nonlinear DBN model are explored to capture the linear and nonlinear behaviours of a time series, respectively. We first use an LR model to fit the original data and obtain the LR model residuals between the original data and the predicted data of the LR model. Then, the residuals are regarded as the nonlinear component and are used as inputs into the DBN model. The LR model prediction and the output of the DBN model are the final forecasting value for the time series, which takes full advantage of the two models for predicting time series. The proposed hybrid model and other existing models are applied to four well-known time series for comparison, and the results show that the proposed hybrid model has a high prediction accuracy and may be a useful tool for time series forecasting. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Deep learning;

These problems are: (a) lagged variable selection, (b) hyperparameter handling, and (c) comparison between ML and classical algorithms. The multiple-case study is composed by 50 single-case studies, which use time series of mean monthly temperature and total monthly precipitation observed in Greece. We focus on two ML algorithms, i.e. neural networks and support vector machines, while we also include four classical algorithms and a naïve benchmark in the comparisons. We apply a fixed methodology to each individual case and, subsequently, we perform a cross-case synthesis to facilitate the detection of systematic patterns. We fit the models to the deseasonalized time series. We compare the one- and multi-step ahead forecasting performance of the algorithms. Regarding the one-step ahead forecasting performance, the assessment is based on the absolute error of the forecast of the last monthly observation. For the quantification of the multi-step ahead forecasting performance we compute five metrics on the test set (last year’s monthly observations), i.e. the root mean square error, the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, the ratio of standard deviations, the coefficient of correlation and the index of agreement. The evidence derived by the experiments can be summarized as follows: (a) the results mostly favour using less recent lagged variables, (b) hyperparameter optimization does not necessarily lead to better forecasts, (c) the ML and classical algorithms seem to be equally competitive. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Hyperparameter optimization; Lagged variable selection; Multi-step ahead forecasting; Neural networks; One-step ahead forecasting; Support vector machines","Artificial intelligence; Forecasting; Mean square error; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Support vector machines; Time series; Coefficient of correlation; Forecasting performance; Hyper-parameter optimizations; Index of agreements; Lagged variables; Multi-step; Root mean square errors; Univariate time series; Learning algorithms; algorithm; artificial neural network; forecasting method; machine learning; optimization; precipitation (climatology); support vector machine; temperature effect; time series analysis; Greece",,,,,"Achen, C.H., Snidal, D., Rational deterrence theory and comparative case studies (1989) World Polit, 41 (2), pp. 143-169; Atiya, A.F., El-Shoura, S.M., Shaheen, S.I., El-Sherif, M.S., A comparison between neural-network forecasting techniques-case study: river flow forecasting (1999) IEEE Trans Neural Netw, 10 (2), pp. 402-409; Ballini, R., Soares, S., Andrade, M.G., Multi-step-ahead monthly streamflow forecasting by a neurofuzzy network model (2001) IFSA World Congress and 20Th NAFIPS International Conference, pp. 992-997. , https://doi.org/10.1109/NAFIPS.2001.944740; Baxter, P., Jack, S., Qualitative case study methodology: Study design and implementation for novice researchers (2008) Qual Rep, 13 (4), pp. 544-559; Belayneh, A., Adamowski, J., Khalil, B., Ozga-Zielinski, B., Long-term SPI drought forecasting in the Awash River basin in Ethiopia using wavelet neural network and wavelet support vector regression models (2014) J Hydrol, 508, pp. 418-429; Breiman, L., Random forests (2001) Mach Learn, 45 (1), pp. 5-32; Brownrigg, R., Minka, T.P., Deckmyn, A., (2017) Maps: Draw Geographical Maps, , https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=maps, R package version 3.2.0; Cortes, C., Vapnik, V., Support-vector networks (1995) Mach Learn, 20 (3), pp. 273-297; Cortez, P., Data mining with neural networks and support vector machines using the R/rminer tool (2010) Advances in data mining.

Firstly, the sample data of container throughput at ports are decomposed into several components. Secondly, the time series of the various components are thoroughly investigated to accurately capture the data characteristics. Then, an individual forecasting model is selected for each component based on the data characteristic analysis (DCA). Finally, the forecasting results are combined as an aggregated output. An empirical analysis is implemented for illustration and verification purposes.

A recursive, AutoRegressive time series model using eXogenous inputs (ARX) and a rolling forecasting origin has been developed to provide reliable short-term forecasts of the internal temperatures in dwellings during hot summer conditions, especially heatwaves. The model was tested using monitored data from three case study dwellings recorded during the 2015 heatwave. The predictor variables were selected by minimising the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), in order to automatically identify a near-optimal model. The model proved capable of performing multi-step-ahead predictions during extreme heat events with an acceptable accuracy for periods up to 72 h, with hourly results achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) below 0.7 °C for every forecast. Comparison between ARX and AutoRegressive Moving Average models with eXogenous inputs (ARMAX) models showed that the ARX models provided consistently more reliable multi-step-ahead predictions. Prediction intervals, at the 95% probability level, were adopted to define a credible interval for the forecast temperatures at different prediction horizons. The results point to the potential for using time series forecasting as part of an overheating early-warning system in buildings housing vulnerable occupants or contents. © 2018 The Authors","ARMAX model; ARX model; Black-box model; Machine learning; Overheating; Time series forecasting","Alarm systems; Hot rolling; Housing; Learning systems; Time series; ARMAX model; ARX model; Black-box model; Overheating; Time series forecasting; Forecasting; air temperature; Akaike information criterion; forecasting method; heat wave; indoor air; machine learning; numerical model; time series analysis",,,,,"NHBC, Overheating in new homes; A review of the evidence (2012), http://www.zerocarbonhub.org/sites/default/files/resources/reports/Overheating_in_New_Homes-A_review_of_the_evidence_NF46.pdf; ZCH, Overheating in homes - The big picture (2016), http://www.zerocarbonhub.org/sites/default/files/resources/reports/ZCH-OverheatingInHomes-TheBigPicture-01.1.pdf; Lomas, K.J., Porritt, S.M., Overheating in buildings: lessons from research (2017) Build.

In this method, the correlation between each individual dissolved gas and other transformers’ features such as temperature characteristics and loading history is first determined. Then, a non-linear principal component analysis (NLPCA) technique is applied to extract the most effective time series from the highly correlated features. Afterwards, the forecasting algorithms are trained using a cross validation technique. In addition, evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms are used to select the most accurate and diverse group of forecasting algorithms to construct an ensemble. Finally, the selected ensemble is examined to predict the value of the dissolved gases on the testing set. The results of one day, two day, three day, and four day ahead forecasting are presented which show higher accuracy and reliability of the proposed method compared with other statistical methods. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Ensemble learning; Evolutionary algorithms; Multi-objective optimization; Power transformers; Time series forecasting","Dissolution; Forecasting; Multiobjective optimization; Power transformers; Principal component analysis; Time series; Time series analysis; Cross-validation technique; Ensemble forecasting; Ensemble learning; Evolutionary multiobjective optimization; Forecasting algorithm; Highly-correlated; Temperature characteristic; Time series forecasting; Evolutionary algorithms",,,,,"Abu-Elanien, A.E.B., Salama, M.M.A., Bartnikas, R., A techno-economic method for replacing transformers (2011) IEEE Trans.

Therefore, forecasting crude oil prices accurately is an essential task for investors, governments, enterprises and even researchers. However, due to the extreme nonlinearity and nonstationarity of crude oil prices, it is a challenging task for the traditional methodologies of time series forecasting to handle it. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel approach that incorporates ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), sparse Bayesian learning (SBL), and addition, namely EEMD-SBL-ADD, for forecasting crude oil prices, following the ""decomposition and ensemble"" framework that is widely used in time series analysis. Specifically, EEMD is first used to decompose the raw crude oil price data into components, including several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and one residue. Then, we apply SBL to build an individual forecasting model for each component. Finally, the individual forecasting results are aggregated as the final forecasting price by simple addition. To validate the performance of the proposed EEMD-SBL-ADD, we use the publicly-availableWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent crude oil spot prices as experimental data. The experimental results demonstrate that the EEMD-SBL-ADD outperforms some state-of-the-art forecasting methodologies in terms of several evaluation criteria such as the mean absolute percent error (MAPE), the root mean squared error (RMSE), the directional statistic (Dstat), the Diebold-Mariano (DM) test, the model confidence set (MCS) test and running time, indicating that the proposed EEMD-SBL-ADD is promising for forecasting crude oil prices. © 2018 by the authors.

In previous study of FTS, the process of aggregating the past observations and assigning proper weights of fuzzy logical relationship groups are ignored, which may lead to poor forecasting accuracy since they are important aspects in time series prediction and analysis where determination of future trends depends only on past observations. In this paper, a novel high-order FTS model is constructed to make time series forecasting. Specifically, by applying the harmony search intelligence algorithm, the optimal lengths of intervals are tuned. Moreover, regularly increasing monotonic quantifiers are employed on fuzzy sets to obtain the weights of ordered weighted aggregation. Simultaneously, the weights of right-hand side of fuzzy logical relationship groups are explored to compensate the presence of bias in the prediction. In the part of empirical analysis, the developed model was applied to predict three well-known time series: numbers of enrollment of Alabama University, TAIEX and electricity load demand of New South Wales and the results obtained were compared with several counterparts, including some old and recently developed models. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed model cannot only achieve higher accuracy of prediction, but also capture the fuzzy features and characters. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Forecasting; Fuzzy logical relationship; High-order fuzzy time series; Weights","Forecasting; Fuzzy logic; Linear control systems; Time series; Fuzzy logical relationship groups; Fuzzy logical relationships; Fuzzy time series; Fuzzy time series (FTS); Non-linear dynamic systems; Ordered weighted aggregations; Weighted fuzzy time series; Weights; Time series analysis",,,,,"Wei, L.-Y., A hybrid ANFIS model based on empirical mode decomposition for stock time series forecasting (2016) Appl.

The data set used consists of ten-year long three-hourly time series of significant wave height HS, peak wave period Tp and wind speed WS based on hindcasts of WAVEWATCH III model and GFS analysis winds. The field used covers the area [30W, 40E]×[50N,78N]. The initial time series is first decomposed by means of the aforementioned nonstationary modelling into a seasonal mean value and a residual time series multiplied by a seasonal standard deviation. Then, the FIS/ANFIS models are applied to the stationary part only in order to calculate forecasts of future values. Using the nonstationary modelling, forecasts of the full time series are finally obtained. For comparison purposes, the FIS/ANFIS models are also applied to the initial nonstationary series. The performance of both forecasting procedures is assessed by means of well-known error measures. The methodology is applied to obtain (a) point-wise forecasts for a specific datapoint and (b) field-wise forecasts for the whole field of wave parameters. Especially, the latter is performed for the first time. The comparison of the error measures from the two approaches showed that the forecasts based on the proposed methodology outperform the ones using only FIS/ANFIS models. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there is a lack of effort on the development of new techniques for solving that problem and, therefore, achieving higher performance, which is important for the efficient management of energy in many levels. This study addresses this gap by proposing a new hybrid machine learning algorithm that incorporates the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system model with a new version of the firefly algorithm denominated as the gender-difference firefly algorithm. We expanded the search space diversification to increase the accuracy on the prediction and adopted the autoregressive process in order to approximate the chaotic behavior of the consumption time series. A new layer, denominated as non-working time adaptation was also integrated so as to decrease the fast variability of the predictions during non-working periods of time. We have applied our algorithm for the consumption prediction on 1 h, 2 h and 3 h ahead horizons. We have obtained improvements on the MAPE and R coefficient when compared with state-of-the-art publications in both a private dataset from the Faculty of Chemistry, located in the city of Murcia, Spain and a public dataset of the consumption of a Retail building located in California, United States. We also show our method's performance in five more buildings. Our results demonstrate the robustness and the accuracy of our proposal when compared to the traditional adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system models and also to the different predictive techniques implemented in several pieces of literature. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","ANFIS; Autoregressive process; Building energy consumption; Gender-difference firefly algorithm; Time series forecasting","Bioluminescence; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Inference engines; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Optimization; Time series; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Artificial intelligence techniques; Auto regressive process; Energy consumption prediction; Hybrid machine learning; Neuro-fuzzy inference systems; Search space diversification; Time series forecasting; Fuzzy inference; accuracy assessment; algorithm; artificial intelligence; energy use; forecasting method; fuzzy mathematics; performance assessment; prediction; time series analysis; California; Murcia [Spain]; Spain; United States",,,,,"Cano, M., Zamora, M.A., G AFS (2013) Context-Aware Energy Efficiency Smart Build, pp. 1-8; Pérez-Lombard, L., Ortiz, J., Pout, C., A review on buildings energy consumption information (2008) Energy Build, 40 (3), pp. 394-398; https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/markets-and-consumers/smart-grids-and-meters, Smart grids and meters n.d.

The objective of the present study is to develop a suite of hourly river flow forecasting models for the Albert river, located in Queensland, Australia using various machine learning (ML) based models including a relatively new and novel artificial intelligent modeling technique known as emotional neural network (ENN). Hourly river flow data for the period 2011–2014 is employed for the development and evaluation of the predictive models. The performance of the ENN model in forecasting hourly stage river flow is compared with other well-established ML-based models using a number of statistical metrics and graphical evaluation methods. The ENN showed an outstanding performance in terms of their forecasting accuracies, in comparison with other ML models. In general, the results clearly advocate the ENN as a promising artificial intelligence technique for accurate forecasting of hourly river flow in the form of real-time. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Albert river;

Moreover, with the emergence of the big data era, the automatic identification with the appropriate techniques remains an intermediate compulsory stage of any big data implementation with predictive analytics purposes. Extensive research on model selection and combination has revealed the benefits of such techniques in terms of forecast accuracy and reliability. Several criteria for model selection have been proposed and used for decades with very good results. Akaike information criterion and Schwarz Bayesian criterion are two of the most popular criteria. However, research on the combination of several criteria along with other sources of information in a unified methodology remains scarce. This study proposes a new model selection approach that combines different criteria using a support vector machine (SVM). Given a set of candidate models, rather than considering any individual criterion, an SVM is trained at each forecasting origin to select the best model. This methodology will be particularly interesting for scenarios with highly volatile demand because it allows changing the model when it does not fit the data sufficiently well, thereby reducing the risk of misusing modeling techniques in the automatic processing of large datasets. The effects of the proposed approach are empirically explored using a set of representative forecasting methods and a dataset of 229 weekly demand series from a leading household and personal care manufacturer in the UK. Our findings suggest that the proposed approach results in more robust predictions with lower mean forecasting error and biases than base forecasts. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Demand forecasting; Model selection; Supply chain; SVM; Time series analysis","Automation; Big data; Predictive analytics; Risk perception; Statistical tests; Supply chains; Support vector machines; Time series; Time series analysis; Akaike information criterion; Appropriate techniques; Automatic identification; Automatic processing; Demand forecasting; Model Selection; Sources of informations; Time series forecasting; Forecasting",,,,,"Adya, M., Collopy, F., Armstrong, J., Kennedy, M., Automatic identification of time series features for rule-based forecasting (2001) International Journal of Forecasting, 17 (2), pp. 143-157; Barrow, D.K., Kourentzes, N., Distributions of forecasting errors of forecast combinations: Implications for inventory management (2016) International Journal of Production Economics, 177, pp. 24-33; Billah, B., King, M.L., Snyder, R.D., Koehler, A.B., Exponential smoothing model selection for forecasting (2006) International Journal of Forecasting, 22 (2), pp. 239-247; Cao, L., Chua, K.S., Chong, W., Lee, H., Gu, Q., A comparison of pca, kpca and ica for dimensionality reduction in support vector machine (2003) Neurocomputing, 55 (1), pp. 321-336; Clemen, R.T., Combining forecasts: A review and annotated bibliography (1989) International Journal of Forecasting, 5 (4), pp. 559-583; Collopy, F., Armstrong, J.S., Rule-based forecasting: Development and validation of an expert systems approach to combining time series extrapolations (1992) Management Science, 38 (10), pp. 1394-1414; Cortes, C., Vapnik, V., Support-vector networks (1995) Machine learning, 20 (3), pp. 273-297; Davenport, T.H., Harris, J.G., Competing on analytics: The new science of winning (2007), Harvard Business Press; Duin, R., Loog, M., Linear dimensionality reduction via a heteroscedastic extension of lda: the chernoff criterion (2004) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 26 (6), pp. 732-739; Fildes, R., Evaluation of aggregate and individual forecast method selection rules (1989) Management Science, 35 (9), pp. 1056-1065; Fildes, R., Petropoulos, F., Simple versus complex selection rules for forecasting many time series (2015) Journal of Business Research, 68 (8), pp. 1692-1701. , Special Issue on Simple Versus Complex Forecasting; Furey, T.S., Cristianini, N., Duffy, N., Bednarski, D.W., Schummer, M., Haussler, D., Support vector machine classification and validation of cancer tissue samples using microarray expression data (2000) Bioinformatics, 16 (10), pp. 906-914; Garcia, F.T., Villalba, L.J.G., Portela, J., Intelligent system for time series classification using support vector machines applied to supply-chain (2012) Expert Systems with Applications, 39 (12), pp. 10590-10599; Hira, Z.M., Gillies, D.F., A review of feature selection and feature extraction methods applied on microarray data (2015) Advances in Bioinformatics, p. 2015; Hyndman, R., Koehler, A.B., Ord, J.K., Snyder, R.D., Forecasting with exponential Smoothing: the State space approach (2008), Springer Science & Business Media; Jarque, C., Bera, A., A test for normality of observations and regression residuals (1987) International Statistical Review, (55), pp. 163-172; Joachims, T., Learning to classify text using support vector machines: Methods, theory and algorithms (2002), Kluwer Academic Publishers; Kim, T.Y., Dekker, R., Heij, C., Spare part demand forecasting for consumer goods using installed base information (2017) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 103, pp. 201-215; Kira, K., Rendell, L.A., (1992), 2, pp. 129-134. , The feature selection problem: Traditional methods and a new algorithm.

The FTSF methods consist of four stages namely determination of effective length of interval, fuzzification of crisp time series data, modeling of fuzzy logical relationships (FLRs) and defuzzification. All the four stages play a vital role in achieving better forecasting accuracy. This paper addresses two key issues such as modeling FLRs and determination of effective length of interval. Three leading machine learning (ML) techniques, namely deep belief network (DBN), long short-term memory (LSTM) and support vector machine (SVM) are first time used for modeling the FLRs. Additionally, a modified average-based method is proposed to estimate the effective length of interval. The proposed FTSF-DBN, FTSF-LSTM and FTSF-SVM methods are being compared with three papers from the literature along with four crisp TSF methods using multilayer perceptron (MLP), LSTM, DBN and SVM. A total of fourteen time series datasets (Sun Spot, Lynx, Mumps and 11 TAIEX time series datasets i.e. 2000–2010) are considered for comparative performance analysis. Results revealed the statistical superiority of FTSF-SVM method and proposed improved average-based method based on the popular Friedman and Nemenyi hypothesis test. It is also observed that the proposed FTSF methods provide statistical superior performance than their crisp TSF counterparts. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Deep belief network (DBN); Fuzzy logical relationship (FLR); Fuzzy time series forecasting (FTSF); Long short-term memory (LSTM); Restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM); Support vector machine (SVM)","Brain; Deep learning; Forecasting; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy neural networks; Long short-term memory; Machine learning; Support vector machines; Time series; Comparative performance analysis; Deep belief network (DBN); Fuzzy logical relationships; Fuzzy time series; Machine learning techniques; Multi layer perceptron; Restricted boltzmann machine; Time series forecasting; Time series analysis",,,,,"Aladag, C.H., Using multiplicative neuron model to establish fuzzy logic relationships (2013) Expert Syst.

The analysis of natural rubber price and volatility can give hedging guidance to manufacturers and provide investors with uncertainty and risk information to reduce investment losses. To effectively analyses and forecast the natural rubber's price and volatility, this paper constructed a hybrid model that integrated the bidirectional gated recurrent unit and variational mode decomposition for short-term prediction of the natural rubber futures on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. In data preprocessing period, time series is decomposed by variational mode decomposition to capture the tendency and mutability information. The bidirectional gated recurrent unit is introduced to return the one-day-ahead prediction of the closing price and 7-day volatility for the natural rubber futures. The experimental results demonstrated that: (a) variational mode decomposition is an effective method for time series analysis, which can capture the information closely related to the market fluctuations; (b) the bidirectional neural network structure can significantly improve the model performance both in terms of fitting performance and the trend prediction; (c) a correspondence was found between the predicted target, i.e., the price and volatility, and the intrinsic modes, which manifested as the impact of the long-term and short-term characteristics on the targets at different time-scales. With a change in the time scale of forecasting targets, it was found that there was some variation in matching degree between the forecasting target and the mode sub-sequences. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","BiGRU; Rubber futures; Time series; VMD; Volatility prediction","Economics; Financial markets; Forecasting; Risk assessment; Rubber; Time series; Uncertainty analysis; Bidirectional neural networks; BiGRU; Data preprocessing; Different time scale; Market fluctuations; Short term prediction; Time series forecasting; Uncertainty and risks; Time series analysis",,,,,"Ahrends, A., Hollingsworth, P.M., Ziegler, A.D., Fox, J.M., Chen, H., Su, Y., Xu, J., Current trends of rubber plantation expansion may threaten biodiversity and livelihoods (2015) Global Environ.

Empirical results for forecasting three benchmark data sets indicate that despite of more popularity of the conventional ARIMA-ANN model, the ANN-ARIMA hybrid model can overall achieved more accurate results. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA); Hybrid linear/nonlinear models; Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs); Series and parallel structures; Time series forecasting","Forecasting; Time series; Time series analysis; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Benchmark data; Comparative studies; Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs); Nonlinear components; Parallel structures; Stock price forecasting; Time series forecasting; Financial markets",,,,,"Aladag, C.H., Egrioglu, E., Kadilar, C., Forecasting nonlinear time series with a hybrid methodology (2009) Applied Mathematics Letters, 22, pp. 1467-1470; Areekul, P., Senjyu, T., Toyama, H., Yona, A., Notice of violation of IEEE publication principles a hybrid ARIMA and neural network model for short-term price forecasting in deregulated market (2010) IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 25, pp. 524-530; Box, P., Jenkins, G.M., (1976) Time series analysis: Forecasting and control, , San Francisco, CA: Holden-day Inc; Chaâbane, N., A hybrid ARFIMA and neural network model for electricity price prediction (2014) International Journal of Electrical Power & Energy Systems, 55, pp. 187-194; Chen, K.-Y., Wang, C.-H., A hybrid SARIMA and support vector machines in forecasting the production values of the machinery industry in Taiwan (2007) Expert Systems with Applications, 32, pp. 254-264; Díaz-Robles, L.A., Ortega, J.C., Fu, J.S., Reed, G.D., Chow, J.C., Watson, J.G., Moncada-Herrera, J.A., A hybrid ARIMA and artificial neural networks model to forecast particulate matter in urban areas: The case of Temuco, Chile (2008) Atmospheric Environment, 42, pp. 8331-8340; Gairaa, K., Khellaf, A., Messlem, Y., Chellali, F., Estimation of the daily global solar radiation based on Box–Jenkins and ANN models: A combined approach (2016) Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 57, pp. 238-249; Kao, L.-J., Chiu, C.-C., Lu, C.-J., Chang, C.-H., A hybrid approach by integrating wavelet-based feature extraction with MARS and SVR for stock index forecasting (2013) Decision Support Systems, 54, pp. 1228-1244; Khashei, M., Bijari, M., An artificial neural network (p, d,q) model for timeseries forecasting (2010) Expert Systems with Applications, 37, pp. 479-489; Khashei, M., Bijari, M., Raissi Ardali, G.H.A., Hybridization of autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) with probabilistic neural networks (PNNs) (2012) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 63, pp. 37-45; Lee, Y.-S., Tong, L.-I., Forecasting time series using a methodology based on autoregressive integrated moving average and genetic programming (2011) Knowledge-Based Systems, 24, pp. 66-72; Monfared, S.A., Enke, D., Volatility forecasting using a hybrid GJR-GARCH neural network model (2014) Procedia Computer Science, 36, pp. 246-253; Nie, H., Liu, G., Liu, X., Wang, Y., Hybrid of ARIMA and SVMs for short-term load forecasting (2012) Energy Procedia, 16, pp. 1455-1460; Pham, H.T., Yang, B.-S., Estimation and forecasting of machine health condition using ARMA/GARCH model (2010) Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 24, pp. 546-558; Rumelhart, D., McClelland, J., (1986) Parallel distributed processing, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Sallehuddin, R., Shamsuddin, S.M., Hashim, S.Z.M., Hybridization model of linear and nonlinear time series data for forecasting (2008) Second Asia International Conference on Modelling & Simulation (AMS), pp. 597-602; Shafie-khah, M., Moghaddam, M.P., Sheikh-El-Eslami, M.K., Price forecasting of day-ahead electricity markets using a hybrid forecast method (2011) Energy Conversion and Management, 52, pp. 2165-2169; Sun, H., Yan, D., Zhao, N., Zhou, J., Empirical investigation on modeling solar radiation series with ARMA–GARCH models (2015) Energy Conversion and Management, 92, pp. 385-395; Wang, J.-J., Wang, J.-Z., Zhang, Z.-G., Guo, S.-P., Stock index forecasting based on a hybrid model (2012) Omega, 40, pp. 758-766; Wang, L., Zou, H., Su, J., Li, L., Chaudhry, S., An ARIMA-ANN Hybrid model for time series forecasting (2013) Systems Research and Behavioral Science, 30, pp. 244-259; Zeng, D., Xu, J., Gu, J., Liu, L., Xu, G., Short term traffic flow prediction using hybrid ARIMA and ANN models (2008) Power Electronics and Intelligent Transportation System, pp. 621-625. , in; Zhang, G.P., Time series forecasting using a hybrid ARIMA and neural network model (2003) Neurocomputing, 50, pp. 159-175; Zhang, G., Patuwo, B.E., Hu, M.Y., Forecasting with artificial neural networks: The state of the art (1998) International Journal of Forecasting, 14, pp. 35-62","Hajirahimi, Z.; Department of Industrial and systems Engineering, Iran; email: Z.Hajirahimi@in.iut.ac.ir",,,"Taylor and Francis Inc.",,,,,03610918,,,,"English","Commun.

A set of deep belief networks (DBNs) is used to build the state-dependent functional coefficients of the SD-AR model, and the proposed model is called DBN-AR model, which combines the advantage of DBN in function approximation and the merit of SD-AR model in nonlinear dynamics description. The DBN-AR model is driven by the state signal changing with time. Based on the least squares solution with minimum norm and the pseudo inverse matrix approach, the initial target values of the DBNs are determined in pre-training stage. In fine tuning stage, all parameters of DBN-AR model is finally tuned by the back propagation (BP) algorithm designed for fine-tuning of DBN-AR model. Through experiment and comparative study on the sunspot data, the electricity load demand data sets from Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), the weekly British Pound/US dollar (GBP/USD) exchange rate data and the daily electricity generation data of the Three Gorges dam right bank power station, it is shown that the DBN-AR model is superior to some existing models or methods in prediction accuracy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Deep belief network; State-dependent AR model; System identification; Time series forecasting","Backpropagation algorithms; Bayesian networks; Forecasting; Identification (control systems); Inverse problems; Time series analysis; Transfer matrix method; Tuning; AR models; Deep belief networks; Electricity generation; Function approximation; Functional coefficients; Least squares solutions; Nonlinear time series; Time series forecasting; Time series",,,,,"Babu, C.N., Reddy, B.E., A moving-average filter based hybrid ARIMA-ANN model for forecasting time series data (2014) Appl.

In this way, models to properly predict variations in the price of products and services could be one of the keys to the success in agribusiness. Consistent models are being adopted by companies as part of a decision making process when important choices are based on short or long-term forecasting. This work aims to evaluate Wavelet Neural Networks (WNNs) performance combined with five optimization techniques in order to obtain the best time series forecasting by considering two case studies in the agribusiness sector. The first one adopts the soybean sack price and the second deals with the demand problem of a distinct groups of products from a food company, where nonlinear trends are the main characteristic on both time series. The optimization techniques adopted in this work are: Differential Evolution, Artificial Bee Colony, Glowworm Swarm Optimization, Gravitational Search Algorithm, and Imperialist Competitive Algorithm. Those were evaluated by considering short-term and long-term forecasting, and a prediction horizon of 30 days ahead was considered for the soybean sack price case, while 12 months ahead was selected for the products demand case. The performance of the optimization techniques in training the WNN were compared to the well-established Backpropagation algorithm and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) assuming accuracy measures. In long-term forecasting, which is considered more difficult than the short-term case due to the error accumulation, the best combinations in terms of precision was reached by distinct methods according to each case, showing the importance of testing different training strategies.

Knowing the dynamic qualities of WSs is mandatory during use, and these qualities vary continuously over time. However, in most cases, the quality information furnished by service providers is static and does not consider dynamic variations in quality over time. Thus, it is necessary to determine a method for acquiring accurate quality values for WSs. The motivation for this research is that the most suitable time-series method for dynamic quality prediction of WSs remains unknown because no comprehensive empirical comparison of the representative time-series methods has been performed. Therefore, in this paper, we implement all the representative time-series methods and compare their dynamic quality predictions for WSs using a real-world quality dataset. For empirical comparison, we have ensured that our study is reproducible and referenceable by providing diverse specifics and evaluating their validity in detail. The experimental results and diverse discussions presented in this paper may act as a valuable reference to both academic researchers and WS consumers and providers in industry because they can depend on the results when selecting the most suitable time-series method for direct use or as a starting point for further modifications. Based on our experimental results, among the included time-series forecasting approaches, genetic programming (GP) can achieve the highest quality of service (QoS) forecasting accuracy (in our experiments, the average mean absolute error and mean absolute percentage error are 1258 and 20%, respectively); however, this approach also requires the longest time to produce a QoS predictor (67.7 s on average). Though auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA, with average error measures of 1343 and 25.4%) and exponential smoothing (ES, with average error measures of 1354 and 25.7%) present slightly worse accuracy than GP, ARIMA and ES require much less time to generate a predictor than GP (on average, 0.1612 and 0.1519 s, respectively); thus, these approaches might represent a compromise between forecasting accuracy and cost. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","QoS prediction; Time-series forecasting; Web service","Errors; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Quality of service; Software design; Time series; Time series analysis; Websites; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Empirical - comparisons; Exponential smoothing; Forecasting accuracy; Mean absolute percentage error; Qos predictions; Quality information; Time series forecasting; Web services",,,,,"Agapitos, A., Dyson, M., Kovalchuk, J., Lucas, S.M., On the genetic programming of time-series predictors for supply chain management (2008) Proceedings of the 10th Annual Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation, New York, pp. 1163-1170. , ACM; Amin, A., Colman, A., Grunske, L., An approach to forecasting QoS attributes of web services based on ARIMA and GARCH models (2012) IEEE 19th International Conference on Web Services (ICWS), Honolulu, pp. 74-81. , IEEE; Amin, A., Grunske, L., Colman, A., An automated approach to forecasting QoS attributes based on linear and non-linear time series modeling (2012) Proceedings of the 27th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, Essen, pp. 130-139. , ACM; Burgess, C.J., Lefley, M., Can genetic programming improve software effort estimation?

Forecasting the demand for transportation is critical in planning and scheduling efficient operations by transportation systems managers. In this paper, a time series forecasting framework based on Box-Jenkins method is developed for public transportation systems. We present a framework that is comprehensive, automated, accurate, and fast. Moreover, it is applicable to any time series forecasting problem regardless of the application sector. It substitutes the human judgment with a combination of statistical tests, simplifies the time-consuming model selection part with enumeration, and it applies a number of comprehensive tests to select an accurate model. We implemented all steps of the proposed framework in MATLAB as a comprehensive forecasting tool. We tested our model on real passenger traffic data from Istanbul Metro. The numerical tests show the proposed framework is very effective and gives higher accuracy than the other models that have been used in many studies in the literature.

Taylor Hall, Baton Rouge, LA  70803, United States","Variations in the price of asphalt cement have become a serious challenge for Departments of Transportation in proper budgeting of transportation projects. This issue has also pressed contractors in their efforts to develop appropriate cost estimates for transportation projects. Although the price of asphalt cement increases over the long term, it is subject to significant short-term variations. In the current state of practice, the following approaches have been utilized to predict the future price of asphalt cement: (1) adding a fixed percentage of the estimated total cost of asphalt cement to escalate the price of asphalt cement (i.e., adding a risk premium); (2) inflating the estimated cost of asphalt cement to the expected midpoint of construction period to estimate the total cost of asphalt cement; and (3) conducting Monte Carlo simulation analysis to characterize uncertainty about future price of asphalt cement. None of these methods consider autocorrelation in the historical records of asphalt cement price. This paper departs from the existing body of knowledge and challenges the lack of proper treatment of short-term variations in predicting asphalt cement price. The research objectives of this paper are to: (1) identify and characterize variations observed in actual prices of asphalt cement over time; and (2) utilize this knowledge to create time-series forecasting models for asphalt cement price and examine whether and how time-series forecasting models can predict future prices of asphalt cement with higher accuracy compared to the existing approaches. Based on the identified time series characteristics, four univariate time series forecasting models, namely Holt Exponential Smoothing (ES), Holt-Winters ES, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and seasonal ARIMA, are created to take into account the short-term variation of asphalt cement price in forecasting its future values. The forecasting results show that all four time series models can predict future prices of asphalt cement with higher accuracy than the existing methods, such as Monte Carlo simulation. Among the four models, the ARIMA and Holt ES models are the most accurate forecasting models with errors less than 2%. This study can help both owners and contractors improve budgeting process, prepare more-accurate cost estimates, and reduce the risk of asphalt cement price variations in transportation projects. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Asphalt; Bituminous materials; Budget control; Cements; Contractors; Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; Costs; Forecasting; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Transportation; Uncertainty analysis; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Departments of transportations; Exponential smoothing; Short-term variations; Time series characteristic; Time series forecasting models; Transportation projects; Univariate time series; Time series analysis",,,,,"Abu Hammad, A.A., Ali, S.M.A., Sweis, G.J., Sweis, R.J., Statistical analysis on the cost and duration of public building projects (2010) J.

The ones which diffuse rapidly and widely are known as viral topics. Predicting the popularity of viral topics is important to online recommendation systems and marketing services. However, the task is still challenging due to the fact that the popularity of viral topics is highly dynamic and little research has been focused on how to predict the popularity accurately for viral topics. This paper first uses data collected from the largest BBS in China to find high correlations for the short-term popularity of viral topics. Based on this finding, this paper then utilizes a time series feature space to capture the behaviors of popularity of viral topics and presents a method for predicting the short-term popularity of a given viral topic by using only data of historical popularity of the topic. This paper demonstrates that our method outperforms a baseline model and one of the most sophisticated methods in the terms of MAPE (mean absolute percentage error) and RAE (relative absolute error). Furthermore, this paper gives out how long the minimum observation period is in order to predict promptly. Finally, this paper uses two cases to show the effectiveness and simplicity of our method. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Popularity prediction; Time series forecasting; Viral topic behavior; Viral topics","Marketing; Online systems; Time series; Mean absolute percentage error; Observation Period; Popularity predictions; Social media platforms; Time series features; Time series forecasting; Viral topic behavior; Viral topics; Forecasting; Article; China; computer analysis; computer graphics; computer interface; computer model; computer prediction; controlled study; forecasting; information; intermethod comparison; mathematical analysis; mathematical computing; mathematical phenomena; mean absolute percentage error; popularity prediction; priority journal; relative absolute error; statistics; time series analysis; trend study; viral topic",,,,,"Wu, F., Huberman, B.A., Novelty and collective attention, Proc.

The evaluation of these new methods requires either collecting or simulating a diverse set of time series benchmarking data to enable reliable comparisons against alternative approaches. We propose GeneRAting TIme Series with diverse and controllable characteristics, named GRATIS, with the use of mixture autoregressive (MAR) models. We simulate sets of time series using MAR models and investigate the diversity and coverage of the generated time series in a time series feature space. By tuning the parameters of the MAR models, GRATIS is also able to efficiently generate new time series with controllable features. In general, as a costless surrogate to the traditional data collection approach, GRATIS can be used as an evaluation tool for tasks such as time series forecasting and classification. We illustrate the usefulness of our time series generation process through a time series forecasting application. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","mixture autoregressive models; simulation; time series features; time series forecasting; time series generation","Forecasting; Auto-regressive; Benchmarking data; Data collection; Evaluation tool; Time series features; Time series forecasting; Time-series data; Time-series generation; Time series analysis",,,,,"Adam, E.E., Individual item forecasting model evaluation (1973) Decis.

For example, product sales can come from different cities, districts, or states; or be grouped by categories and subcategories. This hierarchical structure can be useful for improving the forecast, and this strategy is known as hierarchical time series (HTS) analysis. In this work, a novel strategy for sales forecasting is proposed using Support Vector Regression (SVR) and hierarchical time series. We formalize three different hierarchical time series approaches: bottom-up SVR, top-down SVR, and middle-out SVR, and use them in a sales forecasting project for the Travel Retail Industry. Various hierarchical structures are proposed for the retail industry in order to achieve accurate product-level predictions. Experiments on these datasets demonstrate the virtues of SVR-based hierarchical time series in terms of predictive performance when compared with the traditional ARIMA and Holt-Winters approaches for this task. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Hierarchical time series; Sales forecasting; Support Vector Regression; Time series analysis","Forecasting; Regression analysis; Sales; Disaggregation; Hierarchical structures; Novel strategies; Predictive performance; Retail industry; Sales forecasting; Support vector regression (SVR); Time series forecasting; Time series analysis",,,,,"Ahmed, N.K., Atiya, A.F., El-Gayar, N., El-Shishiny, H., An empirical comparison of machine learning models for time series forecasting (2010) Econometric Reviews, 29 (5-6), pp. 594-621; Athanasopoulos, G., Hyndman, R.J., Kourentzes, N., Petropoulos, F., (2017) Forecasting with temporal hierarchies, , Working Paper; Crone, S., Guajardo, J., Weber, R., Artiticial intelligence in theory and practice (2006) TFTP International Federation for Information Processing, 217, pp. 149-158. , Bramer M.

To fill the research gap, this study analyzes the future coal demand of the United States from a market perspective. Both time-series and econometric forecasting techniques are developed to quantify the change of total coal consumption and coal consumption of electricity (sharing over 90% of total coal consumption) in the United States. The proposed time-series forecasting techniques are based on metabolic grey model, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model-grey model, and induced ordered weighted geometric averaging operator. The mean absolute percent error of the proposed technique is less than 1%, indicating the proposed forecasting technique provides reliable information. The forecasting results obtained by time-series model show coal consumption and coal demand for electricity sector in U.S. will continue to decline in the next decade. The proposed econometric forecasting technique is based on the IPAT identity, grey model and Vector Auto-Regression. The combination econometric forecasting technique is used simultaneously to analyze the impact of various internal factors on coal consumption. The results from the proposed econometric technique also show the decline trend of coal demand in the U.S. Thus, the results from the time-series and econometric forecasting technique are consistent. Based on the quantitative analyses, this study contend that Trump's policy is unlikely to revive the coal industry. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Coal revival; Econometric forecasting technique; Quantitative analysis time-series forecasting model; Trump's energy policy","Chemical analysis; Coal; Forecasting; Time series; Time series analysis; Analysis time; Autoregressive integrated moving average models; Averaging operators; Combined forecasting; Forecasting techniques; Qualitative analysis; Time series forecasting; Time series modeling; Coal industry; coal; comparative study; demand analysis; econometrics; electricity; energy policy; forecasting method; future prospect; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; time series; vector autoregression; United States",,,,,"Trump'sEnergyPolicy, An America first energy plan (2016), https://www.donaldjtrump.com/policies/energy, Available: (Accessed 5 January 2017); EIA, Annual coal report 2011-2015 (2016), U.S. Energy Information Administration Washington, DC; EIA, Coal consumption by sector (2016), https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/browser/?tbl=T06.02%20-%20/?f=A&start=2000&end=2015&charted=1-5-12-13-14, Retrieved 2017-01-05.

One such fresh water source is Vrana Lake, located on the completely karstified Island of Cres in Croatia. Over the last few decades a severe and dangerous decrease of the lake level has been documented. In order to develop a reliable lake level prediction, the application of the artificial neural networks (ANN) was used for the first time. The paper proposes time-series forecasting models based on the monthly measurements of the lake level during the last 38 years, capable to predict 6 or 12 months ahead. In order to gain the best possible model performance, the forecasting models were built using two types of ANN: the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN), and the feed forward neural network (FFNN). Instead of classic lagged data set, the proposed models were trained with the set of sequences with different length created from the time series data. The models were trained with the same set of the training parameters in order to establish the same conditions for the performance analysis. Based on root mean squared error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient (R) the performance analysis shown that both model types can achieve satisfactory results. The analysis also revealed that regardless of the model types, they outperform classic ANN models based on datasets with fixed number of features and one month the prediction period. Analysis also revealed that the proposed models outperform classic time series forecasting models based on ARIMA and other similar methods. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","ANN; Karst hydrology; Lake level;

This led to a growing interest in algorithms and techniques able to predict products future prices, since they allow us to define smart systems able to improve the quality of life by suggesting more affordable goods and services. The joint use of time series, reputation and sentiment analysis clearly represents one important approach to this research issue. In this paper we present Price Probe, a suite of software tools developed to perform forecasting on products' prices. Its primary aim is to predict the future price trend of products generating a customized forecast through the exploitation of autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. We experimented the effectiveness of the proposed approach on one of the biggest E-commerce infrastructure in the world: Amazon. We used specific APIs and dedicated crawlers to extract and collect information about products and their related prices over time and, moreover, we extracted information from social media and Google Trends that we used as exogenous features for the ARIMA model. We fine-estimated ARIMA's parameters and tried the different combinations of the exogenous features and noticed through experimental analysis that the presence of Google Trends information significantly improved the predictions. © 2019 by the author.","Amazon; ARIMA; Google Trends; Machine learning; Smart systems; Time-series forecasting","Costs; Electronic commerce; Learning systems; Sentiment analysis; Time series; Time series analysis; Amazon; ARIMA; Google trends; Smart System; Time series forecasting; Forecasting",,,,,"Zimmermann, S., Herrmann, P., Kundisch, D., Nault, B., Decomposing the Variance of Consumer Ratings and the Impact on Price and Demand (2018) Inf.

In this study we propose to better understand how the uncertainty is propagated in the context of global radiation time series forecasting using machine learning. Indeed we propose to decompose the error considering four kinds of uncertainties: the error due to the measurement, the variability of time series, the machine learning uncertainty and the error related to the horizon. All these components of the error allow to determinate a global uncertainty generating prediction bands related to the prediction efficiency. We also have defined a reliability index which could be very interesting for the grid manager in order to estimate the validity of predictions. We have experimented this method on a multilayer perceptron which is a popular machine learning technique. We have shown that the global error and its components are essential to quantify in order to estimate the reliability of the model outputs. The described method has been successfully applied to four meteorological stations in Mediterranean area. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial neural networks; Energy prediction; Interval; Processing; Stationarity; Time series forecasting","Atmospheric radiation; Errors; Forecasting; Machine learning; Multilayers; Neural networks; Processing; Solar radiation; Time series; Time series analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Energy prediction; Global solar radiation; Interval; Machine learning techniques; Mediterranean areas; Meteorological station; Stationarity; Time series forecasting; Multilayer neural networks; accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; confidence interval; data processing; experimental study; machine learning; model validation; prediction; solar activity; time series analysis; uncertainty analysis",,,,,"Hoff, T.E., Perez, R., Modeling PV fleet output variability (2012) Sol Energy, 86, pp. 2177-2189; Voyant, C., Paoli, C., Muselli, M., Nivet, M.-L., Multi-horizon solar radiation forecasting for Mediterranean locations using time series models (2013) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 28, pp. 44-52; Lauret, P., Voyant, C., Soubdhan, T., David, M., Poggi, P., A benchmarking of machine learning techniques for solar radiation forecasting in an insular context (2015) Sol Energy, 112, pp. 446-457; Mellit, A., Kalogirou, S.A., Hontoria, L., Shaari, S., Artificial intelligence techniques for sizing photovoltaic systems: a review (2009) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 13, pp. 406-419; Lorenz, E., Remund, J., Müller, S.C., Traunmüller, W., Steinmaurer, G., Pozo, D., Benchmarking of different approaches to forecast solar irradiance (2009) 24th Eur.

However, such information granules may be applied not only for the descriptive purposes, but also for prediction. We review the main developments and challenges of the application of the soft computing methods in the time series analysis and forecasting, and we provide a conceptual framework for the Bayesian time series forecasting using the granular computing approach. Within the proposed approach, the information granules are successfully incorporated into the Bayesian posterior simulation process. The approach is evaluated with a set of experiments on the artificial and benchmark real-life time series datasets. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian methods; Data mining; Granular computing; Linguistic summaries; Soft computing; Time series forecasting","Bayesian networks; Data mining; Forecasting; Granular computing; Granulation; Information granules; Soft computing; Bayesian Analysis; Bayesian methods; Conceptual frameworks; Large datasets; Linguistic summaries; Simulation process; Soft computing methods; Time series forecasting; Time series analysis",,,,,"Geweke, J., Contemporary Bayesian econometrics and statistics (2005) Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics, , John Wiley; Koop, G., Bayesian Econometrics (2003), Wiley; Petridis, V., Kehagias, A., Petrou, L., Bakirtzis, A., Kiartzis, S., Panagiotou, H., Maslaris, N., A Bayesian multiple models combination method for time series prediction (2001) J.

Nevertheless, they require a large amount of resources in terms of area and power dissipation. Recently, Reservoir Computing (RC) has arisen as a strategic technique to design recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with simple learning capabilities. In this work, we show a new approach to implement RC systems with digital gates. The proposed method is based on the use of probabilistic computing concepts to reduce the hardware required to implement different arithmetic operations. The result is the development of a highly functional system with low hardware resources. The presented methodology is applied to chaotic time-series forecasting. © 2016 Miquel L.

This paper proposes a self-adaptive, decomposed, heterogeneous, and ensemble learning model for short-term electricity price forecasting one, two, and three-months-ahead in the Brazilian market. Exogenous variables, such as supply, lagged prices and demand are considered as inputs signals of the forecasting model. Firstly, the coyote optimization algorithm is adopted to tune the hyperparameters of complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition in the pre-processing phase. Next, three machine learning models, including extreme learning machine, gradient boosting machine, and support vector regression models, as well as Gaussian process, are designed with the intent of handling the components obtained through the signal decomposition approach with focus on time series forecasting. The individual forecasting models are directly integrated in order to obtain the final forecasting prices one to three-months-ahead. In this case, a grid of forecasting models is obtained. The best forecasting model is the one that has better generalization out-of-sample. The empirical results show the efficiency of the proposed model. Additionally, it can achieve forecasting errors lower than 4.2% in terms of symmetric mean absolute percentage error. The ranking of importance of the variables, from the smallest to the largest is, lagged prices, demand, and supply. This paper provided useful insights for multi-step-ahead forecasting in the electrical market, once the proposed model can enhance forecasting accuracy and stability. © 2020 by the authors.

Support vector machine (SVM) is one of the common data mining methods in the field of machine learning. It has outstanding advantages compared with other methods and it is widely used in various fields. However, there are still many problems in the practical application of the method, and the model itself has many fields that need to be improved. The purpose of this paper is to accurately predict the trend of stock prices, providing a reference model for the trend of stock market and the tracking method of stock price prediction, and provide value reference for research on the forecasting model of stock market and investor’s investment decision. Research using a combined model to predict stock market trends whether will have a significant improvement compared to using a single model to forecast that. The method of this paper is to analyze the shortcomings of current stock market forecasting methods and standard support vector machines firstly, at the same time, based on this, a cumulative auto-regressive moving average is proposed, which combines the least squares support vector machine synthesis model (ARI-MA-LS-SVM) to make basic predictions for the stock market. Secondly, process the data first for the predictive indicators by using cumulative auto-regressive moving average. Then, use the least squares support vector machine of simple indicator system to predict stock price fluctuations. Therefore, it can be concluded that the combined model based on ARI-MA-LS-SVM is more suitable for stock price forecasting than the single forecasting model, and the actual performance is better. At the same time, a large number of simulation experiments show that the algorithm of multiple model’s fusion can achieve the expected effect, which indicate that the model has universal applicability, market applicability and stability feasibility. This model can bring some guidance and reference value for many investors and market regulators. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Attribute reduction; Cumulative auto-regressive moving average;

Therefore, it is a cause for concern around the world, and forecasting the number of future patients and death cases, although not entirely accurate, helps the governments and health-policy makers to make the necessary decisions and impose restrictions to reduce prevalence. Methods: In this study, we aimed to find the best model for forecasting the number of confirmed and death cases in Iran. For this purpose, we applied nine models including NNETAR, ARIMA, Hybrid, Holt-Winter, BSTS, TBATS, Prophet, MLP, and ELM network models. The quality of forecasting models is evaluated by three performance metrics, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. The best model is selected by the lowest value of performance metrics. Then, the number of confirmed and the death cases forecasted for the 30 next days. The used data in this study is the absolute number of confirmed, death cases from February 20 to August 15, 2020. Results: Our findings suggested that based on existing data in Iran, the suitable model with the lowest performance metrics for confirmed cases data obtained MLP network and the Holt-Winter model is the suitable model for forecasting death cases in the future. These models forecasted on September 14, 2020, we will have 2484 new confirmed and 114 new death cases of COVID-19. Conclusion: According to the results of this study and the existing data, we concluded that the MLP and Holt-Winter models had the lowest error in forecasting in comparison to other methods. Some models had fitted poorly in the test phase and this is because many other factors that are either not available or have been ignored in this study and can affect the accuracy of forecast results. Based on the trend of data and forecast results, the number of confirmed cases and death cases are almost constant and decreasing, respectively. However, due to disease progression and ignoring the recommendations and protocols of the Ministry of health, there is a possibility of re-emerging this disease more seriously in Iran and this requires more preventive care. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","ARIMA; BSTS; COVID-19; Forecasting; Hybrid model; NNETAR; Time series","Biomedical engineering; Control engineering; Signal processing; Absolute number; Disease progression; Forecasting models; Modeling and forecasting; Monitoring system; Network models; Performance metrics; Time series forecasting; Forecasting; Article; artificial neural network; auto regressive integrated moving average model; automation; Bayesian network; bayesian structural time series model; cause of death; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; disease exacerbation; extreme leraning machine model; forecasting; holt winter model; human; hybrid model; information processing; intermethod comparison; Iran; learning algorithm; machine learning; mathematical model; measurement accuracy; multilayer perceptron; neural network auto regression model; priority journal; regression analysis; single hidden layer feedforward neural network; TBATS model; time series analysis",,,,,"Al-Qaness, M.A.A., Ewees, A.A., Fan, H., Abd El Aziz, M., Optimization method for forecasting confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China (2020) J.

During flexible operation of conventional coal-fired stations, thermal stresses are induced in reheaters which could lead to tube ruptures and unplanned plant downtime. The current study sets out to develop a data-driven sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural network model capable of predicting future reheater metal temperatures using plant operational data. The best-performing network and training algorithm configuration was found by implementing a coarse grid search of hyperparameter combinations. The proposed model architecture uses stacked encoder and decoder sections with GRU cells and 512 hidden units per layer. An input sequence length of 8 min was used to predict an output sequence of 5 min, with sequence intervals of 1 min. The results indicate that the encoder-decoder GRU network has adequate accuracy.

Effective water resource management requires the identification of the most susceptible regions and periods to such risks and, hence, spatio-temporal prediction tools of groundwater levels. For this purpose, we use 27 years of groundwater level records (between 1984 and 2012) and apply time series forecasting models including seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (HWES). The spatial variation of groundwater levels is investigated by a novel method known as Fixed Rank Kriging (FRK). The results demonstrate that ARIMA outperforms HWES in fitting the training data. In contrast, the 95% confidence bound of ARIMA predictions is wider than that of HWES and ARIMA’s predicted seasonal cycle is weaker. The time series forecasting by a stochastic simulation indicated that if the current situation continues, the level of groundwater is expected to decline from 1635 m to about 1605 m by 2022. The FRK showed that the amount of groundwater extraction in the western part of the aquifer was higher than that of the northern and central parts. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Exponential smoothing;

This is a step toward making informed/explainable decisions in the domain of time series, powered by deep learning. There have been numerous efforts to increase the interpretability of image-centric deep neural network models, where the learned features are more intuitive to visualize. Visualization in the domain of time series is significantly challenging, as there is no direct interpretation of the filters and inputs compared with the imaging modality. In addition, a little or no concentration has been devoted to the development of such tools in the domain of time series in the past. TSViz provides possibilities to explore and analyze the network from different dimensions at different levels of abstraction, which includes the identification of the parts of the input that were responsible for a particular prediction (including per filter saliency), importance of the different filters present in the network, notion of diversity present in the network through filter clustering, understanding of the main sources of variation learned by the network through inverse optimization, and analysis of the network's robustness against adversarial noise. As a sanity check for the computed influence values, we demonstrate our results on pruning of neural networks based on the computed influence information. These representations allow the user to better understand the network so that the acceptability of these deep models for time-series analysis can be enhanced. This is extremely important in domains, such as finance, industry 4.0, self-driving cars, health care, and counter-terrorism, where reasons for reaching a particular prediction are equally important as the prediction itself. We assess the proposed framework for interpretability with a set of desirable properties essential for any method in this direction. © 2019 IEEE.","convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; demystification; feature importance; representation learning; time-series analysis; time-series forecasting; visualization","Convolution; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Flow visualization; Forecasting; Harmonic analysis; Inverse problems; Neural networks; Terrorism; Visualization; Convolutional neural network; demystification; feature importance; representation learning; Time series forecasting; Time series analysis",,,,,"Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Hinton, G.E., ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks (2012) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 25, pp. 1097-1105. , http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf, F.

Several studies have sought to develop more accurate models to predict the future exchange rate by analyzing econometric models, developing artificial intelligence models and combining both through the creation of hybrid models. This paper proposes a hybrid model for forecasting the variations of five exchange rates related to the US Dollar: Euro, British Pound, Japanese Yen, Swiss Franc and Canadian Dollar. The proposed model uses Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to deconstruct the series into independent components as well as neural networks (NN) to predict each component. This method differentiates this study from previous works where ICA has been used to extract the noise of time series or used to obtain explanatory variables that are then used in forecasting. The proposed model is then compared to random walk, autoregressive and conditional variance models, neural networks, recurrent neural networks and long–short term memory neural networks. The hypothesis of this study supposes that first deconstructing the exchange rate series and then predicting it separately would produce better forecasts than traditional models. By using the mean squared error and mean absolute percentage error as a measures of performance and Model Confidence Sets to statistically test the superiority of the proposed model, our results showed that this model outperformed the other models examined and significantly improved the accuracy of forecasts. These findings support this model's use in future research and in decision-making related to investments. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Exchange rate; Hybrid model; Independent Component Analysis; Neural networks; Time series forecasting","Commerce; Decision making; Electronic trading; Forecasting; Independent component analysis; Investments; Mean square error; Neural networks; Time series; Time series analysis; Conditional variance model; Exchange rates; Hybrid model; Independent component analysis(ICA); Independent components; Mean absolute percentage error; Measures of performance; Time series forecasting; Recurrent neural networks",,,,,"Box, G., Jenkins, G., Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control (1976), p. 575. , Holden-Day INC California; Hamilton, J.D., Time Series Analysis (1994), p. 799. , Princeton University Press; Engle, R.F., Autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity with estimates of the variance of United Kingdom inflation (1982) Econometrica, 50 (4), p. 987; Bollerslev, T., Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (1986) J.

Its main novelty lies in its ability to deal with multivariate data, i.e. to consider multiple time series simultaneously, in order to make multi-output predictions. Real-world processes are typically characterised by several interrelated variables, and the future occurrence of certain time series cannot be explained without understanding the influence that other time series might have on the target time series. One key issue in the context of the multivariate analysis is to determine a priori whether exogenous variables must be included in the model or not. To deal with this, a correlation analysis is used to find a minimum correlation threshold that an exogenous time series must exhibit, in order to be beneficial. Furthermore, the proposed approach has been specifically designed to be used in the context of big data, thus making it possible to efficiently process very large time series. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach we use data from Spanish electricity prices. Results have been compared to other multivariate approaches showing remarkable improvements both in terms of accuracy and execution time. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Big data; Forecasting; Multivariate time series","Big data; Forecasting; Multivariant analysis; Time series; Correlation analysis; Correlation threshold; Exogenous variables; Multi variate analysis; Multiple time series; Multivariate approach; Multivariate time series; Time series forecasting; Time series analysis; article; big data; correlation analysis; electricity; exogenous variable; forecasting; prediction; time series analysis",,,,,"Asencio-Cortés, G., Florido, E., Troncoso, A., Martínez-Álvarez, F., A novel methodology to predict urban traffic congestion with ensemble learning (2016) Soft Comput., 20 (11), pp. 4205-4216; Azadeh, A., Ghaderi, S., Sohrabkhani, S., Annual electricity consumption forecasting by neural network in high energy consuming industrial sectors (2008) Energy Convers.

In this paper, based on the analysis of complex network, a novel method is proposed for more accurate time series predictions. First, time series data are mapped into a network by visibility graph. Then, the link prediction method is adopted to calculate the similarity index. Considering that node distance is an important factor in the network, we take that into account to determine the weight coefficients and improve the predictive results. To fully verify the validity of the proposed method, it is applied to some representative time series data sets with different characteristics. The data values are recorded daily, monthly, and yearly. The error measurement and correlation analysis show that our method has a good prediction performance. It is believed that this paper will not only contribute to time series forecasting in theory but also take effect in practice. © 2013 IEEE.","Complex network; link prediction; node distance; time series; visibility graph","Complex networks; Forecasting; Graph theory; Time series; Visibility; Correlation analysis; Link prediction; node distance; Prediction performance; Time series forecasting; Time series prediction; Visibility graphs; Weight coefficients; Time series analysis",,,,,"Guo, Y., Song, X., Li, N., Fang, D., An efcient missing data prediction method based on kronecker compressive sensing in multivariable time series (2018) IEEE Access, 6, pp. 57239-57248; Hirata, Y., Aihara, K., Improving time series prediction of solar irradiance after sunrise: Comparison among three methods for time series prediction (2017) Sol.

In this study, we propose a long-term prediction approach by transforming the original numerical data into some meaningful and interpretable entities following the principle of justifiable granularity. The obtained sequences exhibiting sound semantics may have different lengths, which bring some difficulties when carrying out predictions. To equalize these temporal sequences, we propose to adjust their lengths by involving the dynamic time warping (DTW) distance. Two theorems are included to ensure the correctness of the proposed equalization approach. Finally, we exploit hidden Markov models (HMM) to derive the relations existing in the granular time series. A series of experiments using publicly available data are conducted to assess the performance of the proposed prediction method. The comparative analysis demonstrates the performance of the prediction delivered by the proposed model. © 1993-2012 IEEE.","Dynamic time warping (DTW); hidden Markov models (HMM); information granule; long-term forecasting; time series forecasting","Forecasting; Information granules; Job analysis; Manganese; Metadata; Semantics; Time series analysis; Dynamic time warping; Long-term forecasting; Predictive models; Task analysis; Time series forecasting; Hidden Markov models",,,,,"Box, G.E., Jenkins, G.M., (1976) Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control, , Revised ed.

The main factors that affect the results of the forecasting of these models are partition universe of discourse and determination of fuzzy relations. In this paper, a novel fuzzy time series forecasting method which uses a hybrid artificial fish swarm optimization algorithm for the determination of interval lengths is proposed. Firstly, we introduce the chemotactic behavior of Bacterial foraging optimization into foraging behavior. Secondly, the Levy flight is used as the mutation operator for a mutation strategy. Finally, the new proposed method is applied to a fuzzy time series forecasting and the experimental results show that the proposed model obtain better forecasting results than those of other existing models. It proves the feasibility and validity of above-mentioned approaches. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Artificial fish swarm algorithm; Forecasting; Fuzzy time series; HAFSA; Levy flight","Forecasting;

Many machine learning techniques have been used in this area to predict the stock market price, including regression algorithms which can be useful tools to provide good performance of financial time series prediction. Support Vector Regression is one of the most powerful algorithms in machine learning. There have been countless successes in utilizing SVR algorithm for stock market prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach based on machine learning and filtering techniques. Our proposed approach combines Support Vector Regression and Hodrick–Prescott filter in order to optimize the prediction of stock price. To assess the performance of this proposed approach, we have conducted several experiments using real world datasets. The principle objective of this paper is to demonstrate the improvement in predictive performance of stock market and verify the works of our proposed model in comparison with other optimized models. The experimental results confirm that the proposed algorithm constitutes a powerful model for predicting stock market prices. © 2017, The Author(s).","Business analytics; Decision support; Financial time series forecasting; Hodrick–Prescott filter; Noise filtering techniques; Stock price prediction; Support vector regression",,,,,,"Mahalakshmi, G., Sridevi, S., Rajaram, S., A survey on forecasting time series data (2016) Proceeding of the IEEE international conference on computing technologies and intelligent data engineering, Kovilpatti, India, pp. 7-9; Anandhi, V., Chezian, R.M., Support vector regression in forecasting (2013) Int J Adv Res Comp Commun Eng, 2 (10), pp. 4148-4151; Badics, M.C., Stock market time series forecasting with data mining methods (2014) Finan Econ Rev, 13 (4), pp. 205-225; Li, Z., Li, Y., Yu, F., Ge, D., Adaptively weighted support vector regression for financial time series prediction (2014) Proceeding of the IEEE international joint conference on neural networks.

The ability to predict the mental state of an individual at both current and future time periods could prove critical to healthcare practitioners. Currently, the practical way to predict an individual's mental state is through mental examinations that involve psychological experts performing the evaluations. However, such methods can be time and resource consuming, mitigating their broad applicability to a wide population. Furthermore, some individuals may also be unaware of their mental states or may feel uncomfortable to express themselves during the evaluations. Hence, their anomalous mental states could remain undetected for a prolonged period of time. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the ability of using advanced machine learning based approaches to generate mathematical models that predict current and future mental states of an individual. The problem of mental state prediction is transformed into the time series forecasting problem, where an individual is represented as a multivariate time series stream of monitored physical and behavioral attributes. A personalized mathematical model is then automatically generated to capture the dependencies among these attributes, which is used for prediction of mental states for each individual. In particular, we first illustrate the drawbacks of traditional multivariate time series forecasting methodologies such as vector autoregression. Then, we show that such issues could be mitigated by using machine learning regression techniques which are modified for capturing temporal dependencies in time series data. A case study using the data from 150 human participants illustrates that the proposed machine learning based forecasting methods are more suitable for high-dimensional psychological data than the traditional vector autoregressive model in terms of both magnitude of error and directional accuracy. These results not only present a successful usage of machine learning techniques in psychological studies, but also serve as a building block for multiple medical applications that could rely on an automated system to gauge individuals’ mental states. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Machine learning; Mental state prediction; Multivariate time series","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Forecasting; Medical applications; Regression analysis; Time series; Automatically generated; Machine learning techniques; Mental state; Multivariate time series; Regression techniques; Time series forecasting; Vector autoregressions; Vector autoregressive model; Learning systems; adult; aged; Article; female; forecasting; human; human experiment; learning algorithm; male; mathematical model; measurement accuracy; measurement error; mental health; personalized medicine; prediction; regression analysis; time series analysis; emotion; machine learning; theoretical model; Emotions; Forecasting; Humans; Machine Learning; Mental Health; Models, Theoretical",,,,,"Bashivan, P., Rish, I., Heisig, S., Mental State Recognition via Wearable EEG arXiv preprint.

However, in practice, EVs are usually difficult to obtain and in many cases are not available at all. In this paper, a new causal forecasting approach, called Wavelet Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous variables and Generalized Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (WARIMAX-GARCH) method, is proposed to improve predictive performance and accuracy but also to address, at least in part, the problem of unavailable EVs. Basically, the WARIMAX-GARCH method obtains Wavelet “EVs” (WEVs) from Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous variables and Generalized Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (ARIMAX-GARCH) models applied to Wavelet Components (WCs) that are initially determined from the underlying time series. The WEVs are, in fact, treated by the WARIMAX-GARCH method as if they were conventional EVs. Similarly to GARCH and ARIMA-GARCH models, the WARIMAX-GARCH method is suitable for time series exhibiting non-linear characteristics such as conditional variance that depends on past values of observed data. However, unlike those, it can explicitly model frequency domain patterns in the series to help improve predictive performance. An application to a daily time series of dam displacement in Brazil shows the WARIMAX-GARCH method to remarkably outperform the ARIMA-GARCH method, as well as the (multi-layer perceptron) Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and its wavelet version referred to as Wavelet Artificial Neural Network (WANN) as in [1], on statistical measures for both in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","ARIMA-GARCH model; Exogenous variable; Forecasting; Wavelet decomposition","Forecasting; Frequency domain analysis; Neural networks; Signal encoding; Statistical methods; Time series; Time series analysis; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Conditional heteroscedasticity; Exogenous variables; Forecasting performance; GARCH models; Nonlinear characteristics; Predictive performance; Time series forecasting; Wavelet decomposition; Article; artificial neural network; exogenous variable; forecasting; mathematical computing; mathematical model; priority journal; time series analysis; wavelet analysis; Wavelet Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous variables and Generalized Auto Regressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity",,,,,"Teixeira Júnior, L.A., Souza, R.M., Menezes, L.M., Cassiano, K.M., Pessanha, J.F.M., Souza, R.C., Artificial Neural Network and Wavelet decomposition in the Forecast of Global Horizontal Solar Radiation (2015) Sobrapo, 35, pp. 1-16; Chatfield, C., (2004) The Analysis of Time Series: an Introduction, , 6th ed.

The uncertainty in supply and the short shelf life of blood products have led to a substantial outdating of the collected donor blood. On the other hand, hospitals and blood centers experience severe blood shortage due to the very limited donor population. Therefore, the necessity to forecast the blood supply to minimize outdating as well as shortage is obvious. This study aims to efficiently forecast the supply of blood components at blood centers. Methods. Two different types of forecasting techniques, time series and machine learning algorithms, are developed and the best performing method for the given case study is determined. Under the time series, we consider the Autoregressive (AUTOREG), Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Seasonal ARIMA, Seasonal Exponential Smoothing Method (ESM), and Holt-Winters models. Artificial neural network (ANN) and multiple regression are considered under the machine learning algorithms. Results. We leverage five years worth of historical blood supply data from the Taiwan Blood Services Foundation (TBSF) to conduct our study. On comparing the different techniques, we found that time series forecasting methods yield better results than machine learning algorithms. More specifically, the least value of the error measures is observed in seasonal ESM and ARIMA models. Conclusions. The models developed can act as a decision support system to administrators and pathologists at blood banks, blood donation centers, and hospitals to determine their inventory policy based on the estimated future blood supply. The forecasting models developed in this study can help healthcare managers to manage blood inventory control more efficiently, thus reducing blood shortage and blood wastage. © 2019 Han Shih and Suchithra Rajendran.",,"Decision support systems; Forecasting; Hospitals; Inventory control; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Neural networks; Time series; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Autoregressive moving average; Exponential smoothing method; Forecasting models; Forecasting techniques; Inventory policies; Multiple regressions; Time series forecasting; Blood; administrative personnel; article; artificial neural network; blood bank; blood component; blood donor; circulation; decision support system; forecasting; human; intermethod comparison; inventory control; manager; multiple regression; pathologist; Taiwan; time series analysis; winter; algorithm; blood bank; blood transfusion; comparative study; forecasting; machine learning; procedures; Taiwan; task performance; Algorithms; Blood Banks; Blood Donors; Blood Transfusion; Forecasting; Humans; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Taiwan; Time and Motion Studies",,,,,"(2018) Blood Basics, , http://www.hematology.org/Patients/Basics, American Society Of Hematology, Washington, DC, USA American Society of Hematology; (2018) Blood Types, , https://www.redcrossblood.org/learn-about-blood/blood-types.html, American Red Cross, Washington, DC, USA American Red Cross; Pierskalla, W.P., Supply chain management of blood banks (2014) Operations Research and Health Care: A Handbook of Methods and Applications, pp. 103-145. , New York, NY, USA Kluwer Academic Publishers Operations Research and Health Care: A Handbook of Methods and Applications, 103-145, Kluwer Academic Publishers, New York, NY, USA, 2014; Rajendran, S., Ravindran, A.R., Platelet ordering policies at hospitals using stochastic integer programming model and heuristic approaches to reduce wastage (2017) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 110, pp. 151-164. , 10.1016/j.cie.2017.05.021 2-s2.0-85020253802 Computers & Industrial Engineering, 110, 151-164, 2017; Rajendran, S., Ravindran, A.R., Inventory management of platelets along blood supply chain to minimize wastage and shortage (2019) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 130, pp. 714-730. , 10.1016/j.cie.2019.03.010 2-s2.0-85062900831 Computers & Industrial Engineering, 130, 714-730, 2019; Srinivas, S., Ravindran, A.R., Systematic Review of Opportunities to Improve Outpatient Appointment Systems, pp. 1697-1702. , Proceedings of the IIE Annual Conference 2017 Pittsburgh, PA, USA Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers (IISE) Proceedings of the IIE Annual Conference, 1697-1702, Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers (IISE), 2017; Lestari, F., Anwar, U., Nugraha, N., Azwar, B., Forecasting Demand in Blood Supply Chain (Case Study on Blood Transfusion Unit), 2. , Proceedings of the World Congress on Engineering July 2017 London, UK Proceedings of the World Congress on Engineering, vol II, London, UK, July 2017; Pereira, A., Performance of time-series methods in forecasting the demand for red blood cells transfusion (2004) Transfusion, 44 (5), pp. 739-746. , 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2004.03363.x 2-s2.0-2342492309 Transfusion, 44, no. 5, 739-746, 2004; Bosnes, V., Aldrin, M., Heier, H.E., Predicting blood donor arrival (2005) Transfusion, 45 (2), pp. 162-170. , 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2004.04167.x 2-s2.0-13144297803 Transfusion, 45, no. 2, 162-170, 2005; Fortsch, S.M., Khapalova, E.A., Reducing uncertainty in demand for blood (2016) Operations Research for Health Care, 9, pp. 16-28. , 10.1016/j.orhc.2016.02.002 2-s2.0-84973169178 Operations Research for Health Care, 9, 16-28, 2016; Khaldi, R., Afia, A.E., Chiheb, R., Faizi, R., (2017) Artificial Neural Network Based Approach for Blood Demand Forecasting: Fez Transfusion Blood Center Case, , Rabat, Morocco Mohammed V University Artificial Neural Network Based Approach for Blood Demand Forecasting: Fez Transfusion Blood Center Case, Mohammed V University, Rabat, Morocco, 2017; Nahmias, S., (2008) Production and Operations Analysis, , 6th Irwin, CA, USA McGraw-Hill Production and Operations Analysis, McGraw-Hill, Irwin, CA, USA, 6th edition, 2008; (2017) Forecasting Process Details"" Retrieved from SAS/ETS 14.3 User's Guide, pp. 4150-4177. , SAS, Cary, NC, USA SAS Institute Inc.

During the tunnel construction, 18 tunnel wall collapse failures were documented. This study reviews the boring performance of the TBM during these failures based on the field-collected data for the penetration rate, cutterhead rotation speed, torque, and thrust force, which were obtained at a 1-second interval. The main task in this study includes the development of a time series forecasting (TSF) approach combined with a deep belief network (DBN) that predicts the torque associated with a given penetration rate and rotation speed through a parameter called the drilling efficiency index, TPI, in a neural network. This study begins with a pilot case of a tunnel collapse that eventually caused the TBM construction to be abandoned. In this case, the TSF&DBN algorithm clearly identifies the deviations of the observed TPI values from those given by the neural network, indicating the successful prediction of an unfavorable geological condition. In addition, the cases of 13 other collapse sections are reviewed; of these, 11 clearly exhibit similar performance to the pilot case, whereas the remaining 2 provide no sufficient indications to exclude possible unstable roofs. This preliminary study shows that a systematic and high-quality TBM performance database can be useful in diagnosing adverse geological conditions in conjunction with the proper use of big data and machine learning techniques. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Deep belief network; Drilling efficiency index; Time series prediction; Tunnel boring machine performance prediction; Yinsong Water Diversion Project","Big data; Boring machines (machine tools); Construction equipment; Drilling machines (machine tools); Flood control; Geology; Infill drilling; Learning systems; Neural networks; Tunnels; Continuously measured data; Deep belief network (DBN); Machine learning techniques; Time series forecasting; Tunnel boring machine(TBM); Tunnel construction; Unfavorable geological conditions; Water diversion project; Deep learning; algorithm; drilling; machine learning; prediction; TBM; time series analysis; tunnel; China",,,,,"Ben Taieb, S., Sorjamaa, A., Bontempi, G., Multiple-output modeling for multi-step-ahead time series forecasting (2010) Neurocomputing, 73, pp. 1950-1957; Cao, L., Hong, Y., Zhao, H., Deng, S., Predicting economic time series using a nonlinear deterministic technique (1996) Comput.

In this article, a recently developed eigenvalue decomposition of Hankel matrix (EVDHM) along with the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) is applied to develop a forecasting model for nonstationary time series. The Phillips-Perron test (PPT) is used to define the nonstationarity of time series. EVDHM is applied over a time series to decompose it into respective subcomponents and reduce the nonstationarity. ARIMA-based model is designed to forecast the future values for each subcomponent. The forecast values of each subcomponent are added to get the final output values. The optimized value of ARIMA parameters for each subcomponent is obtained using a genetic algorithm (GA) for minimum values of Akaike information criterion (AIC). Model performance is evaluated by estimating the future values of daily new cases of the recent pandemic disease COVID-19 for India, USA, and Brazil.

Predicting landslides is an important task to enable preventive measures to be made on time. This paper presents an analysis of univariate time-series forecasting data using an auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model, and a dynamic neural network (DNN) model. These techniques rely on the objective of the forecasting, the type of forecasted data, and whether an automatic or manual approach is to be used for forecasting. Different techniques were analyzed on 15-meter landslide sensor data. The objective of this paper is to suggest a best method among well-known models for landslide forecasting. The demonstrated result shows that a dynamic neural network model is best in class for time-series landslide forecasting. Furthermore, upon objectively evaluating the three well-known techniques, the DNN model exhibited a minimum error rate of approximately 0.01 in comparison to other implemented techniques. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","ARIMA;

This paper treats the forecasting problem as a multivariate time series forecasting problem. The electricity load and the corresponding temperature data are analyzed as correlative time series, and are reconstructed to the multivariate phase space. A neural network with random weights and kernels, which combines the advantages of the neural network and support vector machine including simple training and good generalization performance, is used as the forecasting model. Then, in order to further improve the forecasting performance, different weights are applied to the input data in the phase space according to the predictive value, and the resulting model is called weighted neural network with random weights and kernels. Simulation results based on the real world data set from the EUNITE competition show the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Clustering; Load forecasting; Multivariate time series; Neural network with random weights","Electric power plant loads; Phase space methods; Time series; Time series analysis; Clustering; Generalization performance; Load forecasting; Multivariate phase space; Multivariate time series; Power system operations; Random weight; Short term load forecasting; Forecasting",,,,,"Gross, G., Galiana, F.D., Short-term load forecasting (1987) Proc.

It is becoming a mainstream technology for pattern recognition, data mining and intelligent control at industrial scale. Previous work on constructing very deep networks, such as convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network, makes complex tasks such as image classification feasible. However, they are very limited when dealing with irregular data whose features are unstructured or even unknown. The traditional fully connected neural network is contrarily too shallow to extract high-level features. In this paper, we present a balance gate controlled deep network structure to deepen the fully connected neural network. It uses a new gating strategy to control information flow and increase network stability. Experimental results on both irregular regression and time-series forecasting demonstrate that the proposed network out-performs other ad-hoc models and is easier to train in a deeper form than the fully connected neural network. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Balanced gate; Deep neural network; Light-weight training; Regression; Time-series prediction","Data mining; Pattern recognition; Recurrent neural networks; Time series; Balanced gate; Convolutional neural network; Fully connected neural network; Information expression; Light weight; Regression; Time series forecasting; Time series prediction; Deep neural networks; article; forecasting; human; prediction; time series analysis",,,,,"Sze, V., Chen, Y.H., Yang, T.J., Emer, J.S., Efficient processing of deep neural networks: a tutorial and survey (2017) Proceedings of the IEEE, 105 (12), pp. 2295-2329; Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., Hinton, G.E., ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks (2012) Proceedings of the International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 1097-1105; Lipton, Z.C., Berkowitz, J., Elkan, C., A critical review of recurrent neural networks for sequence learning, arXiv preprint (2015); Johnson, R., Zhang, T., Effective Use of Word Order for Text Categorization with Convolutional Neural Networks, arXiv preprint (2014); Ozer, I., Ozer, Z., Findik, O., Noise robust sound event classification with convolutional neural network (2018) Neurocomputing, 272, pp. 505-512; He, K., Zhang, X., Ren, S., Sun, J., Deep residual learning for image recognition (2016) Proceedings of the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 770-778; Ren, S., He, K., Girshick, R., Sun, J., Faster R-CNN: towards real-time object detection with region proposal networks (2017) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis & Machine Intelligence, 6, pp. 1137-1149; Tsironi, E., Barros, P., Weber, C., Wermter, S., An analysis of convolutional long short-term memory recurrent neural networks for gesture recognition (2017) Neurocomputing, 268, pp. 76-86; Tang, Z., Luo, L., Peng, H., Li, S., A joint residual network with paired ReLUs activation for image super-resolution (2018) Neurocomputing, 273, pp. 37-46; Chen, Y., Tao, G., Ren, H., Lin, X., Zhang, L., Accurate seat belt detection in road surveillance images based on CNN and SVM (2018) Neurocomputing, 274, pp. 80-87; Rodriguez, P., Cucurull, G., Gonzalez, J., Gonfaus, J.M., Nasrollahi, K., Moeslund, T.B., Deep pain: exploiting long short-term memory networks for facial expression classification (2017) IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, 99, pp. 1-11; Salehinejad, H., Sankar, S., Barfett, J., Colak, E., Valaee, S., Recent Advances in Recurrent Neural Networks, arXiv preprint (2017); Jurafstki, D., Martin, J.H., Speech and language processing: an introduction to natural language processing, computational linguistics, and speech recognition (2009) Prentice Hall series in Artificial Intelligence, pp. 1-1024; Mikolov, T., Karafiát, M., Burget, L., Cernocký, J., Khudanpur, S., Recurrent neural network based language model (2010) Eleventh Annual Conference of the International Speech and Communication Association (INTERSPEECH 2010), Makuhari, Chiba, Japan, September, 2010, pp. 1045-1048; Zhou, X., Hu, B., Chen, Q., Wang, X., Recurrent convolutional neural network for answer selection in community question answering (2018) Neurocomputing, 274, pp. 8-18; Bourlard, H.A., Morgan, N., Connectionist speech recognition: a hybrid approach (2012), p. 247. , Springer Science & Business Media; Bahdanau, D., Chorowski, J., Serdyuk, D., Brakel, P., Bengio, Y., End-to-end attention-based large vocabulary speech recognition (2016) IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, pp. 4945-4949; Trigeorgis, G., Ringeval, F., Marchi, E., Nicolaou, M.A., Schuller, B., Zafeiriou, S., Adieu features?

In Brazil, such plants produce almost 70% of the total energy. Therefore, it is of great importance to improve the quality of streamflow series forecasting by investigating state-of-the-art time series forecasting algorithms. To this end, this work proposes the development of ensembles of unorganized machines, namely Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) and Echo State Networks (ESNs). Two primary contributions are proposed: (1) a new training logic for ESNs that enables the application of bootstrap aggregation (bagging); and (2) the employment of multi-objective optimization to select and adjust the weights of the ensemble's base models, taking into account the trade-off between bias and variance. Experiments are conducted on streamflow series data from five real-world Brazilian hydroelectric plants, namely those in Sobradinho, Serra da Mesa, Jiraú, Furnas and Água Vermelha. The statistical results for four different prediction horizons (1, 3, 6, and 12 months ahead) indicate that the ensembles of unorganized machines achieve better results than autoregressive (AR) models in terms of the Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), and RMSE-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR). In such results, the ensembles with ESNs and the multi-objective optimization design procedure achieve the best scores. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Echo state network; Ensemble learning; Extreme learning machine; Multi-objective optimization; Streamflow; Time series forecasting","Economic and social effects; Forecasting; Hydroelectric power plants; Knowledge acquisition; Machine learning; Mean square error; Stream flow; Time series analysis; Auto regressive models; Coefficient of determination; Echo state networks; Extreme learning machine; Hydroelectric plant; Primary contribution; Root mean squared errors; Time series forecasting; Multiobjective optimization",,,,,"Al-Sudani, Z.A., Salih, S.Q., Yaseen, Z.M., Development of multivariate adaptive regression spline integrated with differential evolution model for streamflow simulation (2019) J.

Units with a sinusoidal activation function are used to perform a Fourier-like decomposition of training samples into a sum of sinusoids, augmented by units with nonperiodic activation functions to capture linear trends and other nonperiodic components. We show how careful weight initialization can be combined with regularization to form a simple model that generalizes well. Our method generalizes effectively on the Mackey-Glass series, a data set of unemployment rates as reported by the U.S. Department of Labor Statistics, a time-series of monthly international airline passengers, the monthly ozone concentration in downtown Los Angeles, and an unevenly sampled time series of oxygen isotope measurements from a cave in north India. We find that ND outperforms popular time-series forecasting techniques, including long short-term memory network, echo-state networks, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), seasonal ARIMA, support vector regression with a radial basis function, and Gashler and Ashmore's model. © 2012 IEEE.","Extrapolation; neural networks; regression analysis; time series analysis","Chemical activation; Discrete Fourier transforms; Extrapolation; Forecasting; Fourier series; Harmonic analysis; Hidden Markov models; Neural networks; Radial basis function networks; Regression analysis; Time series; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Neural network techniques; Non-periodic components; Predictive models; Radial basis functions; Support vector regression (SVR); Time series forecasting; Weight initialization; Time series analysis",,,,,"Gashler, M.S., Ashmore, S.C., Training deep Fourier neural networks to fit time-series data (2014) Proc. 10th Int.

SSA depends on two main choices: the window length L and the number of eigentriples used for grouping r. One of the most important issues when analyzing time series is the forecast of new observations. When using SSA for time series forecasting there are several alternative algorithms, the most widely used being the recurrent forecasting model, which assumes that a given observation can be written as a linear combination of the L−1 previous observations. However, when the window length L is large, the forecasting model is unlikely to be parsimonious. In this paper we propose a new parsimonious recurrent forecasting model that uses an optimal m(<L−1) coefficients in the linear combination of the recurrent SSA. Our results support the idea of using this new parsimonious recurrent forecasting model instead of the standard recurrent SSA forecasting model.

This paper proposes a novel multi-granularity combined prediction model for multi-factors fuzzy time series forecasting. The proposed model utilizes the clustering algorithm to generate different lengths of intervals, and forecasts the fuzzy trend in different granular spaces. It calculates the final forecasted value by using the forecasted fuzzy trend in each granular space and the optimal weighting vector obtained by particle swarm techniques. The proposed model can transform the uncertain problem to a certain problem through the granular computing theory. The experiments show that the presented model can not only obtain higher forecasting accuracy than several existing methods to forecast the Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX) and the civilian unemployment rate, but also capture and interpret the fuzzy trend. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Fuzzy time series; Fuzzy trend forecasting; Granular space; Multi-granularity combined prediction model; Particle swarm techniques","Clustering algorithms; Computation theory; Electronic trading; Forecasting; Time series; Time series analysis; Vector spaces; Fuzzy time series; Fuzzy trends; Granular space; Particle swarm; Prediction model; Particles (particulate matter); accuracy; algorithm; Article; fuzzy system; fuzzy trend forecasting; mathematical computing; multi granularity combined prediction model; particle swarm technique; priority journal; process optimization; statistical model; statistical parameters; time series analysis",,,,,"Contreras, J., Espinola, R., Nogales, F.J., ARIMA models to predict next-day electricity prices (2003) Power Syst.

Accounting for the multiseasonal patterns becomes necessary to generate more accurate and meaningful forecasts in these contexts. In this article, we propose long short-term memory multiseasonal net (LSTM-MSNet), a decomposition-based unified prediction framework to forecast time series with multiple seasonal patterns. The current state of the art in this space is typically univariate methods, in which the model parameters of each time series are estimated independently. Consequently, these models are unable to include key patterns and structures that may be shared by a collection of time series. In contrast, LSTM-MSNet is a globally trained LSTM network, where a single prediction model is built across all the available time series to exploit the cross-series knowledge in a group of related time series. Furthermore, our methodology combines a series of state-of-the-art multiseasonal decomposition techniques to supplement the LSTM learning procedure. In our experiments, we are able to show that on data sets from disparate data sources, e.g., the popular M4 forecasting competition, a decomposition step is beneficial, whereas, in the common real-world situation of homogeneous series from a single application, exogenous seasonal variables or no seasonal preprocessing at all are better choices. All options are readily included in the framework and allow us to achieve competitive results for both cases, outperforming many state-of-the-art multiseasonal forecasting methods. © 2012 IEEE.","Long short-term memory (LSTM); multiple seasonality; neural networks (NNs); recurrent neural network (RNN); time-series forecasting","Forecasting; Predictive analytics; Time series; Decomposition technique; Forecasting methods; Learning procedures; Model parameters; Prediction model; Real world situations; Seasonal patterns; Univariate method; Long short-term memory; article; competition; decomposition; forecasting; learning; long short term memory network; prediction; time series analysis",,,,,"(2019) Innovation and Research-Ausgrid, , https://www.ausgrid.com.au/Industry/Innovation-and-research/, AusGrid, Accessed: May 16, 2019; Lee, C.-M., Ko, C.-N., Short-term load forecasting using lifting scheme and ARIMA models (2011) Expert Syst.

As there is no general methodology in the literature that addresses this problem analytically and from a time series forecasting perspective (even less so in the cloud field), we propose a combination of these tools based on a state-of-the-art forecasting methodology which we have enhanced with some elements, such as: a specific cost function, statistical tests, visual analysis, etc. The insights obtained from this analysis are used to detect the asymmetrical nature of the forecasting problem and to find the best forecasting model from the viewpoint of the current state of the art in time series forecasting. From an operational point of view the most interesting forecast is a short-time horizon, so we focus on this. To show the feasibility of this methodology, we apply it to several realistic workload datasets from different datacenters. The results indicate that the analyzed series are non-linear in nature and that no seasonal patterns can be found. Moreover, on the analyzed datasets, the penalty cost as usually included in the SLA can be reduced to a 30 percent on average. © 2013 IEEE.","Cloud computing; Elasticity; Machine learning; Time series forecasting; Workload forecasting","Cloud computing; Cost benefit analysis; Cost functions; Elasticity; Financial data processing; Forecasting; Industry; Learning systems; Problem solving; Computational model; Computing services; Forecasting problems; General methodologies; Predictive models; Seasonal patterns; State of the art; Time series forecasting; Time series analysis",,,,,"Buyya, R., Broberg, J., Goscinski, A.M., (2011) Cloud Computing Principles and Paradigms, , Hoboken NJ USA: Wiley; (2013) Gartners 2013 CIO Agenda Report, , http://www.gartner.com/imagesrv/cio/pdf/cio-agenda-insights2013.pdf, Gartner.

During the procedures of building IoT systems, QoS-aware service selection is an important concern, which requires the ranking of a set of functionally similar services according to their QoS values. In reality, however, it is quite expensive and even impractical to evaluate all geographically-dispersed IoT services at a single client to obtain such a ranking. Nevertheless, distributed measurement and ranking aggregation have to deal with the high dynamics of QoS values and the inconsistency of partial rankings. To address these challenges, we propose a time-aware service ranking prediction approach named TSRPred for obtaining the global ranking from the collection of partial rankings. Specifically, a pairwise comparison model is constructed to describe the relationships between different services, where the partial rankings are obtained by time series forecasting on QoS values. The comparisons of IoT services are formulated by random walks, and thus, the global ranking can be obtained by sorting the steady-state probabilities of the underlying Markov chain. Finally, the efficacy of TSRPred is validated by simulation experiments based on large-scale real-world datasets. © 2017 by the authors.

The Coronavirus disease 2019 crisis has provided a unique opportunity to investigate how such a landscape-scale lockdown can influence the national electricity system. However, the impacts of social and economic restrictions on daily electricity demands are still poorly understood. This paper investigated how the UK-wide electricity demand was influenced during the Coronavirus disease 2019 crisis based on multivariate time series forecasting with Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory, to comprehend its correlations with containment measures, weather conditions, and renewable energy supplies. A deep-learning-based predictive model was established for daily electricity demand time series forecasting, which was trained by multiple features, including the number of coronavirus tests (smoothed), wind speed, ambient temperature, biomass, solar & wind power supplies, and historical electricity demand. Besides, the effects of Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on the Net-Zero target of 2050 were also studied through an interlinked approach. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bi-LSTM; Coronavirus disease 2019; Electricity demand; Renewable power supplies","Brain; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Time series; Wind; Wind power; Bi-LSTM; Coronavirus disease 2019; Coronaviruses; Electricity demands; Landscape scale; Multivariate time series; Performance; Renewable power supply; Short term memory; Time series forecasting; Electric power utilization; alternative energy; COVID-19; demand-side management; energy planning; epidemic; multivariate analysis; time series analysis; United Kingdom; Coronavirus",,,,,"(2020) Worldometer, , https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/uk-population/, (Accessed 19 August 2020); (2020) Analysis: UK electricity generation in 2018 falls to lowest level since 1994.

Firstly, on the basis of the maximal wavelet decomposition (MWD) and fuzzy C-means algorithm, a decomposition method decomposes wind power time series and classifies the decomposition time series components into three classes according to amplitude–frequency characteristics. Then, time series models on the basis of least-squares support vector machine (LSSVM) with three different kernels are established for these three classes. Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II optimizes the parameters of each forecasting model. Finally, outputs of forecasting models are reconstructed to obtain the forecasting power. The proposed model is compared with the empirical-mode-decomposition least-squares support vector machine (EMD-LSSVM) model and wavelet-decomposition least-squares support vector machine (WDLSSVM) model. The results of the comparison show that proposed model performs better than these benchmark models. © 2020 ISA","Least-squares support vector machines; Short-term wind power forecasting; Time series forecasting model;

In this research, smart water meters were implemented, distributed, and installed in a regional area in Cairo while data were collected at uniform intervals then sent to the cloud instantly. The solution paradigm uses an Internet of Things (IoT) based on micro-services and containers. The design incorporates real-time streaming and infrastructure performance optimization to store data. A second layer to analyze the acquired data was used to model water consumption using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The designed LSTM is validated and tested to be utilized in the forecast of future water demand. Moreover, two alternative machine learning methods, namely Support Vector Regression and Random Forest commonly utilized in time series forecasting applications, were used for a comparative analysis of which LSTM has proven to be superior. The proper integration of the system elements is the key to the proposed system success. Based on the success of the designed system, it can be applicable on a national scale. That can enable the optimal management of consumers' demand and improve water infrastructure utilization. The proposed paradigm presents a testbed for various scenarios that can be used in water resources management. © 2013 IEEE.","IoT; LSTM; micro-services; resources management; time series; Water smart meters","Decision trees; Forecasting; Internet of things; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Multilayer neural networks; Support vector regression; Time series analysis; Water supply; Comparative analysis; Internet of Things (IOT); Machine learning methods; Performance optimizations; Real time streaming; Time series forecasting; Water infrastructure; Water resources management; Water resources",,,,,"Kumura, T., Suzuki, N., Takahashi, M., Tominaga, S., Morioka, S., Ivan, S., Smart water management technology with intelligent sensing and ICT for the integrated water systems (2015) Nec Tech.

Traditional models usually partition the global universe of discourse, which is not appropriate for all objectives. For example, the universe of the secular trend model is continuously variational. In addition, most forecasting methods rely on prior information, i.e., fuzzy relationship groups (FRG). Numerous relationship groups lead to the explosive growth of relationship library in a linear model and increase the computational complexity. To overcome problems above and ascertain an appropriate order, an intuitionistic fuzzy time series forecasting model based on order decision and adaptive partition algorithm is proposed. By forecasting the vector operator matrix, the proposed model can adjust partitions and intervals adaptively. The proposed model is tested on student enrollments of Alabama dataset, typical seasonal dataset Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX) and a secular trend dataset of total retail sales for social consumer goods in China. Experimental results illustrate the validity and applicability of the proposed method for different patterns of dataset. © 2017 Beijing Institute of Aerospace Information.","adaptive partition; forecasting; intuitionistic fuzzy set; order deciding; time series; vector operator matrix","Electronic trading; Forecasting; Fuzzy sets; Sales; Time series; Adaptive partitions; Intuitionistic fuzzy; Intuitionistic fuzzy sets; order deciding; Student enrollments; Taiwan stock exchanges; Universe of discourse; Vector operators; Time series analysis",,,,,"Song, Q., Chissom, B.S., Forecasting enrollments with fuzzy time series-Part I (1993) Fuzzy Sets Systems, 54 (1), pp. 1-9; Song, Q., Chissom, B.S., Forecasting enrollments with fuzzy time series-Part II (1994) Fuzzy Sets Systems, 62 (1), pp. 1-8; Chen, S.M., Forecasting enrollments based on fuzzy time series (1996) Fuzzy Sets Systems, 81 (3), pp. 311-319; Hwang, J.R., Chen, S.M., Lee, C.H., Handling forecasting problems using fuzzy time series (1998) Fuzzy Sets Systems, 100 (2), pp. 217-228; Huarng, K., Heuristic models of f uzzy time series for forecasting (2001) Fuzzy Sets Systems, 123 (2), pp. 369-386; Huarng, K., Yu, H.K., The application of neural networks to forecast fuzzy time series (2006) Physica A, 363 (2), pp. 481-491; Park, J., Lee, D.J., Song, C.K., TAIFEX and KOSPI 200 forecasting based on two-factor high-order fuzzy time series and particle swarm optimization (2010) Expert Systems with Applications, 37 (2), pp. 959-967; Song, Q., A note on fuzzy time series model relation with sample autocorrelation functions (2003) Cybernetics and Systems, 34 (2), pp. 93-107; Cheng, C.H., Chang, J.R., Entropy-based and trapezoid fuzzification based fuzzy time series approaches for forecasting IT project cost (2006) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 73 (5), pp. 524-542; Jilani, T.A., Burney, S.M.A., Multivariate stochastic fuzzy forecasting models (2008) Expert Systems with Applications, 35 (3), pp. 691-700; Liu, J.W., Chen, T.L., Cheng, C.H., Adaptive-expectation based multi-attribute FTS model for forecasting TAIEX (2010) Computers and Mathematics with Applications, 59 (2), pp. 195-802; Chen, S.M., Forecasting enrollments based on high-order fuzzy time series (2002) Cybernetics and System, 33 (1), pp. 1-8; Own, C.M., Yu, P.T., Forecasting fuzzy time series on a heuristic high-order model (2005) Cybernetics and Systems, 36 (7), pp. 705-717; Lee, L.W., Wang, L.H., Chen, S.M., Handling forecasting problems based on two-factors high-order fuzzy time series (2006) IEEE Trans.

The model combines exponential smoothing (ETS), advanced long short-term memory (LSTM), and ensembling. ETS extracts dynamically the main components of each individual time series and enables the model to learn their representation. Multilayer LSTM is equipped with dilated recurrent skip connections and a spatial shortcut path from lower layers to allow the model to better capture long-term seasonal relationships and ensure more efficient training. A common learning procedure for LSTM and ETS, with a penalized pinball loss, leads to simultaneous optimization of data representation and forecasting performance. In addition, ensembling at three levels ensures a powerful regularization. A simulation study performed on the monthly electricity demand time series for 35 European countries confirmed the high performance of the proposed model and its competitiveness with classical models such as ARIMA and ETS as well as state-of-the-art models based on machine learning.

During the last decade, powerful deep learning methodologies have been efficiently applied for time-series forecasting; however, they cannot guarantee the development of reliable prediction models. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for supporting deep learning in enhancing accurate, efficient and reliable time-series models. The major novelty of our proposed methodology is that it ensures a time-series to be “suitable” for fitting a deep learning model by performing a series of transformations in order to satisfy the stationarity property. The enforcement of stationarity is performed by the application of Augmented Dickey–Fuller test and transformations based on first differences or returns, without the loss of any embedded information. The reliability of the deep learning model’s predictions is guaranteed by rejecting the hypothesis of autocorrelation in the model’s errors, which is demonstrated by autocorrelation function plots and Ljung–Box Q test. Our numerical experiments were performed utilizing time-series from three real-world application domains (financial market, energy sector, cryptocurrency area), which incorporate most of global research interest. The performance of all forecasting models was compared on both problems of forecasting time-series price (regression) and time-series directional movements (classification). Additionally, the reliability of the models’ forecasts was evaluated by examining the existence of autocorrelation in the errors. Our numerical experiments indicate that our proposed methodology considerably improves the forecasting performance of a deep learning model, in terms of efficiency, accuracy and reliability. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Deep learning;

However, they are often limited in their handling of nonlinear and chaotic data. More recently, reservoir-based recurrent neural net systems, most notably echo state networks (ESN), have made substantial improvements for time series modeling. Their shallow nature lends themselves to an efficient training method, but has limitations on nonstationary, nonlinear chaotic time series, particularly large, multidimensional time series. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for forecasting time series data based on an additive decomposition (AD) applied to the time series as a preprocessor to a deep echo state network. We compare the performance of our method, AD-DeepESN, on popular neural net architectures used for time series prediction. Stationary and nonstationary data sets are used to evaluate the performance of the methods. Our results are compelling, demonstrating that AD-DeepESN has superior performance, particularly on the most challenging time series that exhibit non-stationarity and chaotic behavior compared to existing methods. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Additive decomposition; Echo state network; Recurrent neural network; Reservoir computing; Time series forecasting","Forecasting; Time series; Time series analysis; Additive decomposition; Chaotic time series; Echo state networks; Forecasting time series; Multidimensional time series; Non-stationarities; Time series modeling; Time series prediction; Recurrent neural networks",,,,,"Bar-Joseph, Z., Gerber, G.K., Gifford, D.K., Jaakkola, T.S., Simon, I., Continuous representations of time-series gene expression data (2003) J Comput Biol, 10 (3-4), pp. 341-356; Taylor, S.J., (2007) Modeling Financial Time Series; Gottman, J.M., (1981) Time-series analysis: a comprehensive introduction for social scientists, 400. , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; Billinton, R., Chen, H., Ghajar, R., Time-series models for reliability evaluation of power systems including wind energy (1996) Microelectron Reliab, 36 (9), pp. 1253-1261; Ghil, M., Vautard, R., Interdecadal oscillations and the warming trend in global temperature time series (1991) Nature, 350, pp. 324-327; Maqsood, I., Khan, M.R., Abraham, A., An ensemble of neural networks for weather forecasting (2004) Neural Comput Appl, 13 (2), pp. 112-122; Taylor, J.W., Buizza, R., Neural network load forecasting with weather ensemble predictions (2002) IEEE Trans Power Syst, 17 (3), pp. 626-632; Lin, X., Yang, Z., Song, Y., Short-term stock price prediction based on echo state networks (2009) Expert Syst Appl, 36 (3), pp. 7313-7317; Bernal, A., Fok, S., Pidaparthi, R., (2012) Financial Market Time Series Prediction with Recurrent Neural Networks the Challenge of Time Series Prediction Echo State Network Implementation, pp. 1-5; Jaeger, H., (2001) The “echo state” Approach to Analysing and Training Recurrent Neural Networks-With an Erratum Note, , German National Research Institute for Computer Science; Zhang, P.G., Time series forecasting using a hybrid ARIMA and neural network model (2003) Neurocomputing.; Nason, G.P., Stationary and non-stationary time series (2006) Stat Volcanol, 1994, p. 29; Palachy, S., Stationarity in time series analysis (2019) Towards Data Science, , https://towardsdatascience.com/stationarity-in-time-series-analysis-90c94f27322; Zaiontz, C., (2018) Dickey–Fuller Test, , http://www.real-statistics.com/time-series-analysis/stochastic-processes/dickey-fuller-test/; Boshnakov, G.N., Introductory time series with R (2010) J Time Ser Anal, 3, p. 1.; Hochreiter, S., The vanishing gradient problem during learning recurrent neural nets and problem solutions (1998) Int J Uncertainty Fuzziness Knowl Based Syst, 6 (2), pp. 107-116. , 10.1142/S0218488598000094, 10.1142/S0218488598000094 DOI; Cummins, F., Gers, F.A., Schmidhuber, J., Learning to forget: Continual prediction with LSTM (2000) Neural Comput, 2, pp. 850-855. , 10.1197/jamia.M2577, 10.1197/jamia.M2577 DOI; Chung, J., Gulcehre, C., Cho, K., Bengio, Y., (2014) Empirical Evaluation of Gated Recurrent Neural Networks on Sequence Modeling, pp. 1-9. , http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3555, Retrieved from; Lukoševičius, M., Jaeger, H., Reservoir computing approaches to recurrent neural network training (2009) Comput Sci Rev, 3 (3), pp. 127-149. , 10.1016/J.COSREV.2009.03.005; Lukoševičius, M., A practical guide to applying Echo State Networks (2012) Neural networks: tricks of the trade.

One of the main tasks in order to optimize our transportation networks is to build data-driven real-time decision support systems. However, the dynamic environments where the networks operate disallow the traditional assumptions required to put in practice many off-the-shelf supervised learning algorithms, such as finite training sets or stationary distributions. In this paper, we propose BRIGHT: a drift-aware supervised learning framework to predict demand quantities. BRIGHT aims to provide accurate predictions for short-term horizons through a creative ensemble of time series analysis methods that handles distinct types of concept drift. By selecting neighborhoods dynamically, BRIGHT reduces the likelihood of overfitting. By ensuring diversity among the base learners, BRIGHT ensures a high reduction of variance while keeping bias stable. Experiments were conducted using three large-scale heterogeneous real-world transportation networks in Porto (Portugal), Shanghai (China), and Stockholm (Sweden), as well as with controlled experiments using synthetic data where multiple distinct drifts were artificially induced. The obtained results illustrate the advantages of BRIGHT in relation to state-of-the-art methods for this task. © 1989-2012 IEEE.","concept drift; ensemble learning; global positioning system (GPS) data; machine learning; mobility intelligence; taxi passenger demand; Time-series forecasting","Decision support systems; Forecasting; Global positioning system; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Real time systems; Supervised learning; Taxicabs; Concept drifts; Ensemble learning; Passenger demands; Real-time decision support systems; State-of-the-art methods; Stationary distribution; Time series forecasting; Transportation network; Time series analysis",,,,,"Astrom, K.J., Hagglund, T., (1995) PID Controllers: Theory, Design, and Tuning, , 2 ed.

This paper suggests a new forecasting hybrid model for financial time series data combined Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT) technique with improved Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) neural network, and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) linear analysis algorithm. The EWT is used to decompose and denoise the data to reconstruct the data more suitable for forecast. The improvement of the ABC algorithm is according to the Good Point Sets (GPS) theory and adaptive Elite-based Opposition (EO) strategy (GPS-EO-ABC) to overcome the drawbacks of the original algorithm and enhance the optimization performance. The optimized ELM with GPS-EO-ABC, as well as the ARIMA, are utilized independently to generated different forecasting results and combined by the weight-based procession. We testify the performance of the proposed improved ABC algorithm by ten benchmark functions, simulating the proposed forecasting models by three financial time-series datasets. The results indicate that: (1) The proposed algorithm shows outstanding capacities in parameter optimization. The optimized ELM generated more stable and precise results compared with original ELM, ABC-ELM, single LSTM, and ANN; (2) The proposed hybrid model has not only effectiveness but also efficiencies in denoising data, correcting outliers, coordinating both linear and nonlinear patterns, its performance in financial time series forecasting is more excellent than existing hybrid models. © 2013 IEEE.","ARIMA model; EWT data prepossessing; Financial time-series forecasting; GPS-EO-ABC ELM model; hybrid model methodology","Autoregressive moving average model; Benchmarking; Finance; Financial data processing; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Machine learning; Optimization; Wavelet transforms; Artificial bee colony algorithms (ABC); Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Benchmark functions; Extreme learning machine; Financial time series; Financial time series forecasting; Original algorithms; Parameter optimization; Time series analysis",,,,,"Tsay, R.S., (2005) Analysis of Financial Time Series, , Hoboken NJ USA Wiley; Yanfeng, S., Yanchun, L., Jingqing, J., Chunguo, W., Neural network method in financial time series prediction (2004) Jilin Univ.

An efficient forward feature selection strategy has been designed for dealing with high-frequency time series with multiple seasonal periods. Inspired by the literature on feature selection for support vector classification, we designed a technique for assessing the contribution of additional covariates to the SVR solution, including them in a forward fashion. Our strategy extends the reasoning behind Auto-ARIMA, a well-known approach for automatic model specification for traditional time series analysis, to kernel machines. Experiments on well-known high-frequency datasets demonstrate the virtues of the proposed method in terms of predictive performance, confirming the virtues of an automatic model specification strategy and the use of nonlinear predictors in time series forecasting. Our empirical analysis focus on the energy load forecasting task, which is arguably the most popular application for high-frequency, multi-seasonal time series forecasting. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Automatic model specification; Energy load forecasting; Feature selection; Forecasting; Support vector regression","Feature extraction; Forecasting; Harmonic analysis; Specifications; Support vector regression; Forward feature selections; High frequency time series; Nonlinear predictors; Predictive performance; Seasonal time series; Support vector classification; Support vector regression (SVR); Time series forecasting; Time series analysis",,,,,"AlRashidi, M.R., El-Naggar, K.M., Long term electric load forecasting based on particle swarm optimization (2010) Applied Energy, 87 (1), pp. 320-326; Ambroise, C., McLachlan, G.J., Selection bias in gene extraction on the basis of microarray gene-expression data (2002) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 99 (10), pp. 6562-6566; Amjady, N., Keynia, F., Mid-term load forecasting of power systems by a new prediction method (2008) Energy Conversion and Management, 49 (10), pp. 2678-2687; Anderson, B., Torriti, J., Explaining shifts in uk electricity demand using time use data from 1974 to 2014 (2018) Energy Policy, 123, pp. 544-557; Bejan, A.I., Gibbens, R.J., Kelly, F.P., Statistical aspects of storage systems modelling in energy networks (2012) 2012 46th annual conference on information sciences and systems (ciss), pp. 1-6; Chikobvu, D., Sigauke, C., (2013), Modelling in influence of temperature on daily peak electricity demand in south africa.

Recently hesitant fuzzy set has gained attention of the researchers to address issue of aforesaid non-stochastic hesitation. In this research paper, we propose and develop a computational algorithm-based method for financial time series forecasting using hesitant fuzzy set. The proposed method uses hesitant fuzzy logical relations that are constructed using triangular fuzzy sets with equal and unequal intervals. In the proposed forecasting method, hesitant fuzzy logical relations are aggregated using a hesitant fuzzy aggregation operator. Advantages of developed hesitant fuzzy set based forecasting method are that it is easy to implement, can cope with huge time series database and enhances the accuracy in financial time series forecast. To see the performance of proposed method in financial time series forecasting, it is implemented on two financial experimental dataset of TAIFEX and SBI share price at BSE. Rigorous comparison analysis of the proposed forecasting method is done by comparing it with other conventional and computational fuzzy time series forecasting methods in terms of RMSE, AFER.

ANN is a kind of machine learning method utilized widely for streamflow time series, and which performs well in forecasting nonstationary time series without the need of physical analysis for complex and dynamic hydrological processes. Most studies take multiple factors determining the streamflow as inputs such as rainfall. In this study, a long-term streamflow forecasting model depending only on the historical streamflow data is proposed. Various preprocessing techniques, including empirical mode decomposition (EMD), ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT), are first used to decompose the streamflow time series into simple components with different timescale characteristics, and the relation between these components and the original streamflow at the next time step is analyzed by ANN. Hybrid models EMD-ANN, EEMD-ANN and DWT-ANN are developed in this study for long-term daily streamflow forecasting, and performance measures root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) indicate that the proposed EEMD-ANN method performs better than EMD-ANN and DWT-ANN models, especially in high flow forecasting. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","artificial neural network (ANN); discrete wavelet translate (DWT); empirical mode decomposition (EMD); ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD); hybrid model; long-term streamflow forecasting","Discrete wavelet transforms; Forecasting; Learning systems; Mean square error; Neural networks; Signal reconstruction; Time series; Time series analysis; Wavelet decomposition; Discrete wavelets; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Ensemble empirical mode decompositions (EEMD); Hybrid model; Streamflow forecasting; Stream flow",,,,,"Aqil, M., Kita, I., Yano, A., Nishiyama, S., A comparative study of artificial neural networks and neuro-fuzzy in continuous modeling of the daily and hourly behaviour of runoff (2007) Journal of Hydrology, 337 (1-2), pp. 22-34; Aubert, A.H., Tavenard, R., Emonet, R., de Lavenne, A., Malinowski, S., Guyet, T., Gascuel-Odoux, C., Clustering flood events from water quality time series using latent Dirichlet allocation model (2013) Water Resources Research, 49 (12), pp. 8187-8199; Budu, K., Comparison of wavelet-based ANN and regression models for reservoir inflow forecasting (2014) Journal of Hydrologic Engineering, 19 (7), pp. 1385-1400; Chen, J., Brissette, F.P., Combining stochastic weather generation and ensemble weather forecasts for short-term streamflow prediction (2015) Water Resources Management, 29 (9), pp. 3329-3342; Cheng, C.T., Chau, K.W., Flood control management system for reservoirs (2004) Environmental Modelling and Software, 19, pp. 1141-1150; Cheng, C.T., Feng, Z.K., Niu, W.J., Liao, S.L., Heuristic methods for reservoir monthly inflow forecasting: A case study of Xinfengjiang reservoir in Pearl River, China (2015) Water, 7 (8), pp. 4477-4495; Dariane, A.B., Azimi, S., Forecasting streamflow by combination of a genetic input selection algorithm and wavelet transforms using ANFIS models (2016) Hydrological Sciences Journal, 61 (3), pp. 585-600; de Vos, N.J., Rientjes, T.H.M., Constraints of artificial neural networks for rainfall–runoff modelling: Trade-offs in hydrological state representation and model evaluation (2005) Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 9, pp. 111-126; Esmaeelzadeh, S.R., Adib, A., Alahdin, S., Long-term streamflow forecasts by adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system using satellite images and K-fold cross-validation (case study: Dez, Iran) (2015) KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering, 19 (7), pp. 2298-2306; Fotovatikhah, F., Herrera, M., Shamshirband, S., Chau, K.W., Ardabili, S.F., Piran, M.J., Survey of computational intelligence as basis to big flood management: Challenges, research directions and future work (2018) Engineering Applications of Computational Fluid Mechanics, 12, pp. 411-437; Govindaraju, R.S., Rao, A.R., Artificial neural networks: A passing fad in hydrology?

In the conventional applications of energy price forecasting, models are selected based on preliminary assumptions on causality and model structure (e.g. lag length in lagged variables). Relaxation of those assumptions would cause over-fitting and reduce the degree of freedom. Considering the ultimate objective of forecasting models, any variations of models may be tested in the out-of-sample period, and the optimization problem can be redefined as minimization of post-sample error metric in a validation set. By this, data mining would be a legitimate operation for economic forecasting, and it also proves required conditions usually tested by diagnostic tests such as Akaike Information Criterion for model quality. IMSE is a multi-input/single output difference equation based approach which allows users to test various models (for given set of explanatory variables) as well as various order of lagged inputs (lag length) without a priori assumption or theoretical basis except defining set of potential inputs. Finally, it selects the best model subject to predictive accuracy in a validation set. Empirical results indicated that the proposed algorithm significantly outperformed a broad range of benchmark methodologies as well as proving that certain assumptions of econometric approach (e.g. statistical significance of explanatory variables) are independent of predictive performance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Model mining; Oil prices; Predictive analytics; Time series forecasting","Benchmarking; Costs; Data mining; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Difference equations; Forecasting; Predictive analytics; Search engines; Akaike information criterion; Economic forecasting; Explanatory variables; Oil Prices; Optimization problems; Predictive performance; Statistical significance; Time series forecasting; Crude oil price; Akaike information criterion; analytical method; artificial intelligence; crude oil; data mining; engine; forecasting method; numerical model; operations technology; optimization; prediction; price dynamics; time series analysis",,,,,"Hoover, K.D., Perez, S.J., Data mining reconsidered: encompassing and the general to specific approach to specification search (1999) Econom J, 2 (2), pp. 167-191; Sullivan, R., Timmermann, A., White, H., Dangers of data mining: the case of calendar effects in stock returns (2001) J Econom, 105 (1), pp. 249-286; Chen, S.-H., Wang, P.P., Computational intelligence in economics and finance (2004) Computational intelligence in economics and finance, pp. 3-55. , Springer; LeBaron, B., Agent-based computational finance (2006) Handbook Comput Econ, 2, pp. 1187-1233; Reid, D.J., A comparative study of time series prediction techniques on economic data (1969), University of Nottingham, Library Photographic Unit; Reid, D.J., A review of short-term projection techniques (1975) Pract Aspect Forecast, pp. 8-25; Newbold, P., Granger, C.W.J., Experience with forecasting univariate time series and the combination of forecasts (1974) J Roy Stat Soc Ser A (General), pp. 131-165; Makridakis, S., Andersen, A., Carbone, R., Fildes, R., Hibon, M., Lewandowski, R., The accuracy of extrapolation (time series) methods: results of a forecasting competition (1982) J Forecast, 1 (2), pp. 111-153; Makridakis, S., Hibon, M., The M3-competition: results, conclusions and implications (2000) Int J Forecast, 16 (4), pp. 451-476; Makridakis, S., Hibon, M., Moser, C., Accuracy of forecasting: an empirical investigation (1979) J Roy Stat Soc Ser A (General), pp. 97-145; Hill, G., Fildes, R., The accuracy of extrapolation methods; an automatic BoxJenkins package Sift (1984) J Forecast, 3 (3), pp. 319-323; Lusk, E.J., Neves, J.S., A comparative ARIMA analysis of the 111 series of the Makridakis competition (1984) J Forecast, 3 (3), pp. 329-332; Koehler, A.B., Murphree, E.S., A comparison of results from state space forecasting with forecasts from the Makridakis competition (1988) Int J Forecast, 4 (1), pp. 45-55; Hyndman, R.J., Koehler, A.B., Snyder, R.D., Grose, S., A state space framework for automatic forecasting using exponential smoothing methods (2002) Int J Forecast, 18 (3), pp. 439-454; Hamilton, J.D., Oil and the macroeconomy since World War II (1983) J Polit Econ, 91 (2), pp. 228-248; Burbidge, J., Harrison, A., Testing for the effects of oil-price rises using vector autoregressions (1984) Int Econ Rev, pp. 459-484; Gisser, M., Goodwin, T.H., Crude oil and the macroeconomy: tests of some popular notions: note (1986) J Money Credit Bank, 18 (1), pp. 95-103; Cuaresma, J.C., Hlouskova, J., Kossmeier, S., Obersteiner, M., Forecasting electricity spot-prices using linear univariate time-series models (2004) Appl Energy, 77 (1), pp. 87-106; Coppola, A., Forecasting oil price movements: exploiting the information in the futures market (2008) J Futures Market, 28 (1), pp. 34-56; Murat, A., Tokat, E., Forecasting oil price movements with crack spread futures (2009) Energy Econ, 31 (1), pp. 85-90; Baumeister, C., Kilian, L., Real-time forecasts of the real price of oil (2012) J Bus Econ Stat, 30 (2), pp. 326-336; Alquist, R., Kilian, L., Vigfusson, R.J., Forecasting the price of oil (2013) Handbook Econ Forecast, 2, pp. 427-507; Tan, Z., Zhang, J., Wang, J., Xu, J., Day-ahead electricity price forecasting using wavelet transform combined with ARMIA and GARCH models (2010) Appl Energy, 87 (11), pp. 3606-3610; Naser, H., Estimating and forecasting the real prices of crude oil: a data rich model using a dynamic model averaging (DMA) approach (2016) Energy Econ, 56, pp. 75-87; Yin, L., Yang, Q., Predicting the oil prices: do technical indicators help?

Specific attention was paid to surface temperatures of thermal bridges (TBs), which represent HT weakness points because they provide refuge to insects and increase expenditure of electric power due to heat flux loss. Air and TB surface temperatures were monitored in a flour mill during execution of an HT. A first thermal analysis showed that values of indoor air temperatures near TBs were always lower than the computed temperature level that would also guarantee insect mortality on TB surfaces. Since the length of the steady-state air temperature profile was lower than that lethal to all insect vital stages, time series forecasting models based on trend analyses were used to simulate the suitable HT duration. The results highlighted that HT should be increased by 9 h to achieve an air temperature above 45 °C. Finally, to obtain TB surface temperatures lethal to insects, simulations were performed of building interventions capable of reducing sensible heat flux loss through the TBs by using insulating materials. The method described in this paper could help operators define a more suitable HT length and support flour mill owners in decision-making when building interventions to improve heat capacity of the mill envelope should be considered to reduce the power consumption of HT. © 2017 IAgrE","Building insulating materials; Food safety; Heat flux reduction; Temperature distribution; Thermal behaviour","Atmospheric temperature; Decision making; Electric losses; Food safety; Heat flux; Heat treatment; Specific heat; Surface properties; Temperature distribution; Thermal insulating materials; Thermoanalysis; Time series analysis; Flux reduction; Indoor air temperature; Sensible heat flux; Surface temperatures; Temperature trends; Thermal behaviours; Thermal simulations; Time series forecasting models; Insect control",,,,,"Akdoǧan, H., Casada, M.E., Dowdy, A.K., Subramanyam, B., A novel method for analyzing grain facility heat treatment data (2005) Journal of Stored Products Research, 41 (2), pp. 175-185; Augustin, M., Udabage, P., Advances in food and nutrition research.

Novel state-space models characterizing sparse patterns of dependence among multiple time series extend existing multivariate volatility models to enable scaling to higher numbers of individual time series. The theory of these dynamic dependence network models shows how the individual series can be decoupled for sequential analysis and then recoupled for applied forecasting and decision analysis. Decoupling allows fast, efficient analysis of each of the series in individual univariate models that are linked – for later recoupling – through a theoretical multivariate volatility structure defined by a sparse underlying graphical model. Computational advances are especially significant in connection with model uncertainty about the sparsity patterns among series that define this graphical model; Bayesian model averaging using discounting of historical information builds substantially on this computational advance. An extensive, detailed case study showcases the use of these models and the improvements in forecasting and financial portfolio investment decisions that are achievable. Using a long series of daily international currencies, stock indices and commodity prices, the case study includes evaluations of multi-day forecasts and Bayesian portfolio analysis with a variety of practical utility functions, as well as comparisons against commodity trading advisor benchmarks.

Irrigation management, an essential practice for the development of sustainable agriculture, seeks, through the forecast of Reference Evapotranspiration (ETo), to know in advance the water requirements of crops to plan and manage water resources. However, there is still a gap in the literature regarding the application and evaluation of deep learning models and ensemble models to forecasting reference evapotranspiration in irrigation management. In this context, this paper aims to explore the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in the prediction of ETo time series. Three CNNs with different structures were employed to predict a daily time series. Also, in order to evaluate the ensemble forecast of ETo time series, we apply four ensemble models composed of these CNNs in order to produce a probabilistic forecast. This information can be useful for planning and controlling irrigation of crops. Through experimental tests on a real database, the results showed the feasibility of the CNN models for forecasting ETo and that ensemble models were better than the well-known Seasonal ARIMA and Seasonal Naive and improved predictions in terms of variance, precision and computational cost in relation to the individual CNN models, in addition to allowing the estimation of uncertainty, as their outputs are probability distributions. In order to promote reproducibility of this research, all data and codes are publicly available. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Convolutional neural networks; Ensemble learning; Reference evapotranspiration; Time series prediction","Agricultural robots; Climate change; Convolution; Crops; Deep learning; Distributed database systems; Evapotranspiration; Forecasting; Irrigation; Population statistics; Probability distributions; Time series; Water supply; Computational costs; Different structure; Irrigation management; Planning and controlling; Probabilistic forecasts; Reference evapotranspiration; Sustainable agriculture; Time series forecasting; Convolutional neural networks; agricultural development; agricultural practice; alternative agriculture; artificial neural network; crop plant; ensemble forecasting; evapotranspiration; forecasting method; time series analysis; water resource",,,,,"Adhikari, R., Verma, G., Time series forecasting through a dynamic weighted ensemble approach (2016), pp. 455-465. , http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-81-322-2538-6_47, In: 3rd International Conference on Advanced Computing, Networking and Informatics, Smart Innovation, Systems and Technologies (ICACNI).

Such events are likely to result in widespread overheating in the built environment, with a consequential increase in heat-related morbidity and mortality. In order to warn the population of such risks, Heat-Health Warning Systems (HHWSs) are being progressively adopted world-wide. Current HHWSs are, however, based solely on weather observations and forecasts and are unable to identify precisely where, when, or to what extent individual buildings (and their occupants) will be affected. In contrast, AutoRegressive models with eXogenous inputs (ARX) have been demonstrated to reliably forecast indoor temperatures in individual rooms using minimal data. Thus, the large-scale deployment of forecasting models could theoretically enable the development of a high-resolution indoor HHWS (iHHWS). In this study, ARX models were tested over the long-lasting UK heatwave of 2018 using hourly monitored dry-bulb temperature data from 25 rooms (12 living rooms and 13 bedrooms) in 12 dwellings, located within the London Urban Heat Island (UHI). The study investigates different approaches to improving the reliability of room-based heat exposure predictions at longer forecasting horizons. The effectiveness of the iHHWS system was assessed by evaluating the accuracy of predictions (using fixed and adaptive temperature thresholds) at different lead times (1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h ahead). Compared to forecasted indoor temperatures, a Cumulative Heat Index (CHI) metric was shown to increase the reliability of heat-health warnings up to 24 h ahead. © 2019 The Authors","ARX model; Heatwave; Indoor heat health warning system (iHHWS); Indoor temperature; Overheating; Time series forecasting","Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Health; Health risks; Housing; Space heating; ARX model; Heat health warning systems; Heatwave; Indoor temperature; Overheating; Time series forecasting; Weather forecasting; climate change; forecasting method; heat wave; indoor air; temperature gradient; time series analysis",,,,,"NHBC Foundation, Overheating in New Homes: A Review of the Evidence (2012); Zero Carbon Hub (ZCH), Overheating in homes - the big picture (2015), http://www.zerocarbonhub.org/sites/default/files/resources/reports/ZCH-OverheatingInHomes-TheBigPicture-01.1.pdf, Available at:; Lomas, K.J., Porritt, S.M., Overheating in buildings: lessons from research (2017) Build.

In this paper, we formulate a holistic machine learning strategy to analyze the temporal dynamics of temperature and dengue data and use this knowledge to produce accurate predictions of dengue, based on temperature on an annual scale. The temporal dynamics are extracted from historical data by utilizing a novel multi-stage combination of auto-encoding, window-based data representation and trend-based temporal clustering. The prediction is performed with a trend association-based nearest neighbour predictor. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is evaluated in a case study that comprises the number of dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever cases collected over the period 1985-2010 in 32 federal states of Mexico. The empirical study proves the viability of the proposed strategy and confirms that it outperforms various state-of-the-art competitor methods formulated both in regression and in time series forecasting analysis. © 2013 IEEE.","Clustering; machine learning; predictive analysis; time-series analysis","Forecasting; Learning systems; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; Accurate prediction; Clustering; Data representations; Dengue hemorrhagic fever; Machine learning approaches; Temporal clustering; Time series forecasting; Tropical countries; Time series analysis",,,,,"https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/44188/9789241547871_eng.pdf;jsessionid=CC50DEFFCE9B8F70CB41F0B22A6661FC?sequence=1,2019-01-29, World Health Organization.

This work proposes a sliding-window metaheuristic optimization for interval-valued time series forecasting using multi-output least squares support vector regression (MLSSVR). The hyperparameters in MLSSVR are finetuned using an accelerated particle swarm optimization algorithm to yield the best predictions and fastest convergence. The proposed system has a graphical user interface that is developed in a computing environment and functions as a stand-alone application. The system is validated using stock prices as well as exchange rates and outputs are compared with published results. Finally, the proposed interval time series prediction method is tested in two case studies; one involves the daily Australian dollar and Japanese yen rates (AUD/JPY) and the other involves US dollar and Canadian dollar rates (USD/CAD). The proposed model is promising for interval time series forecasting. © 2013 IEEE.","accelerated particle swarm optimization; financial services industry; hybrid system; interval forecasting; least squares support vector regression; multi-input multi-output; Sliding window; time series","Financial data processing; Forecasting; Graphical user interfaces; Hybrid systems; Investments; Machine learning; MIMO systems; Particle accelerators; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Service industry; Swarm intelligence; Time series; Time series analysis; Accelerated particles; Financial services industries; Interval forecasting; Least squares support vector regression; Multi input multi output; Sliding Window; Support vector regression",,,,,"Korol, T., A fuzzy logic model for forecasting exchange rates (2014) Knowl.-Based Syst., 67, pp. 49-60. , Sep; Moore, R.E., Yang, C., Interval analysis i (1959) Lockheed Missiles Space Division, , Sunnyvale, CA, USA, Tech.

However, how to more accurately forecast time series with good efficiency is still an open question. To address this issue, we propose an efficient time series forecasting method based on the DC algorithm and visibility relations on the vertexes set. Firstly, the time series is mapped into the network by the DC algorithm, which is a more efficient approach to generate the visibility graph. Then, we use the variation trends (slope) of those nodes that have visibility relation with the last node to get the preliminary predictive values. Afterward, the value of the last node is adopted to obtain the revised predictive values, which are assigned different weights according to node degree and time distance to get the final weighted result. To better demonstrate the prediction performance and applicability of the proposed method, the proposed method is applied to different time series data sets. The empirical results show that the proposed method could provide a higher level of forecasting accuracy than many methods with relatively lower time complexity. © 2013 IEEE.","Complex network; node degree; time series forecasting; variation trend; visibility graph","Complex networks; Forecasting; Graph theory; Time series; Visibility; Forecasting accuracy; Hot research topics; Node degree; Prediction performance; Time series forecasting; Time series prediction; variation trend; Visibility graphs; Time series analysis",,,,,"Song, J., Lu, J., Wang, E., Lu, M., An, Z., Liu, Y., Zeng, X., Wu, W., Short-term effects of ambient temperature on the risk of premature rupture of membranes in Xinxiang, China: A time-series analysis (2019) Set Total Environ, 689, pp. 1329-1335. , Nov; Troncoso, A., Ribera, P., Asencio-Cortes, G., Vega, I., Gallego, D., Imbalanced classification techniques for monsoon forecasting based on a new climatic time series (2018) Environ.

The speed prediction promotes the route discovery process for the selection of moderate mobility nodes to provide reliable routing. The ARIMA is a time-series forecasting approach, which uses autocorrelations to predict the future speed of nodes. In the paper, the ARIMA model and recurrent neural network (RNN) trains the random waypoint mobility (RWM) dataset to forecast the mobility of the nodes. The proposed ARIMA model designs the prediction models through varying the delay terms and changing the numbers of hidden neuron in RNN. The Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), auto-correlation function (ACF), and partial auto-correlation function (PACF) parameters evaluate the predicted mobility dataset to estimate the model quality and reliability. The different scenarios of changing node speed evaluate the performance of prediction models. Performance results indicate that the ARIMA forecasted speed values almost match with the RWM observed speed values than RNN values. The graphs exhibit that the ARIMA predicted mobility values have lower error metrics such as mean square error (MSE), root MSE (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) than RNN predictions. It yields higher futuristic speed prediction precision rate of 17% to 24% throughout the time series as compared with RNN. Further, the proposed model extensively compares with the existing works. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","ARIMA; MANETs; mobility prediction; neural networks; random waypoint","Errors; Forecasting; Function evaluation;

The proposed Forecasting with Linguistic Summaries (F-LS) approach combines multiple autoregressive models in line with the Bayesian model averaging. However, instead of defining prior probability distributions, practitioners summarize trends with natural language, and then, the system creates the probability distributions basing on the learning database, summarization methods and selected classification algorithms. F-LS approach is evaluated with experiments on the real-life time series from the pharmaceutical market and on the benchmark time series. The results confirm that linguistic summaries are useful and successful for the predictive purposes. Incorporation of the summarization results for forecasting in line with the granular computing approach significantly improves its accuracy in the real-life use case of forecasting pharmaceutical demand, and the forecasting error is around 5 times smaller than for the naive method. Performance of the proposed F-LS on benchmark datasets with automatically discovered linguistic summaries enables to improve the accuracy by 3.5% compared to benchmarks. © 2018","Bayesian analysis; Forecasting; Granular computing; Judgmental forecasting; Linguistic summarization; Model averaging; Summarization; Time series","Abstracting; Bayesian networks; Benchmarking; Classification (of information); Forecasting; Granular computing; Linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Time series; Time series analysis; Auto regressive models; Bayesian Analysis; Bayesian model averaging; Classification algorithm; Linguistic summarization; Model averaging; Summarization; Time series forecasting; Probability distributions",,,,,"Attneave, F., Some informational aspects of visual inspection (1954) Psychol.

For this purpose, a Dynamic factor analysis and AutoRegressive Integrated Moving-Average model with eXogenous inputs (ARIMAX) are used. Both methodologies are integrated into a novel four-stage heuristic procedure. Firstly, dynamic factors are extracted from external macroeconomic indicators influencing the observed throughput. Secondly, the family of ARIMAX models of different orders is generated based on the derived factors. In the third stage, the diagnostic and goodness-of-fit testing is applied, which includes statistical criteria such as fit performance, information criteria, and parsimony. Finally, the best model is heuristically selected and tested on the real data of the Port of Koper. The results show that by applying macroeconomic indicators into the forecasting model, more accurate future throughput forecasts can be achieved. The model is also used to produce future forecasts for the next four years indicating a more oscillatory behaviour in (2018-2020). Hence, care must be taken concerning any bigger investment decisions initiated from the management side. It is believed that the proposed model might be a useful reinforcement of the existing forecasting module in the observed port. © 2017, Faculty of Transport and Traffic Engineering.

Among the available techniques, those based on machine learning models have sparked the interest of the scientific community in recent decades due to their good adaptability and forecasting accuracy, particularly when coupled with data pretreatment methods. These algorithms include artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVMs). In the present study, a comparative analysis of a set of machine learning models, namely, an ANN and an SVM coupled with wavelet transform and data resampling with the bootstrap method, was performed. The analysis of these models was performed with daily streamflow time series for Sobradinho Reservoir, which is located in northeastern Brazil, corresponding to the period between 1931 and 2015. The results show that higher accuracy is achieved by the ANN than by the SVM. Furthermore, the best combination for predicting the streamflow into the Sobradinho Reservoir was the bootstrap, wavelet and neural network (BWNN) method. For a forecast 3 to 15 days ahead, this method yielded a mean square error (MSE) 15 to 25 times lower than that of the purely neural model (ANN), and the R2 and mean absolute error (MAE) coefficients increased by more than 7 to 28% and 13 to 50%, respectively. Therefore, the BWNN is an alternative approach for future time series forecasting studies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial neural networks; Bootstrap; Discrete wavelet transform; Flow prediction; SVM","Forecasting; Mean square error; Neural networks; Reservoirs (water); Stream flow; Support vector machines; Time series; Time series analysis; Water resources; Wavelet transforms; Forecasting accuracy; Forecasting techniques; Machine learning models; Scientific community; Streamflow forecasting; Support vector machine (SVMs); Time series forecasting; Water resource planning; Learning systems",,,,,"Benke, K.K., Lowell, K.E., Hamilton, A.J., Parameter uncertainty, sensitivity analysis and prediction error in a water-balance hydrological model (2008) Math.

However, the irregularity of the error series and the unknown nature of combinations of different forecasters may strongly impact the performance of hybrid systems. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel method for time series prediction, in which error decomposition and a nonlinear combination of forecasters are introduced. The proposed method performs the following: (i) linear modeling to obtain the error series, (ii) error decomposition by using variational mode decomposition (VMD), (iii) nonlinear modeling and a phase fix procedure for the error subseries, and (iv) a combination of forecasters through an appropriate combination function generated by a nonlinear model. By using the proposed method, this paper constructs two hybrid systems, in which the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) is used for linear modeling, and two artificial intelligence (AI) models, namely, the multilayer perceptron (MLP) and support vector regression (SVR), are used for nonlinear modeling and combination, respectively. Finally, four time series data sets, six evaluation metrics, two single models and thirteen hybrid systems are used to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method. The empirical results show that hybrid systems based on error decomposition and a nonlinear combination of forecasters can achieve better performance than some existing systems and models. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA); Error series; Hybrid system; Machine learning; Time series forecasting; Variational mode decomposition (VMD)","Autoregressive moving average model; Forecasting; Hybrid systems; Multilayer neural networks; Nonlinear systems; Support vector regression; Time series; Accurate performance; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Error decomposition; Linear and nonlinear models; Multi layer perceptron; Nonlinear combination; Support vector regression (SVR); Time series prediction; Errors; article; artificial intelligence; comparative effectiveness; decomposition; forecasting; multilayer perceptron; prediction; support vector machine; time series analysis; two hybrid system",,,,,"Wang, J.J., Wang, J.Z., Zhang, Z.G., Guo, S.P., Stock index forecasting based on a hybrid model (2012) Omega, 40, pp. 758-766; Ramos, P., Santos, N., Rui, R., Performance of state space and ARIMA models for consumer retail sales forecasting (2015) Robot.

The PM concentration in the air causes haze and affects the lungs and the heart, leading to reduced visibility, allergic reactions, pneumonia, asthma, cardiopulmonary diseases, lung cancer, and even death. In this context, the development of systems for monitoring, forecasting, and controlling emissions plays an important role. The literature about forecasting systems based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) ensembles has been highlighted regarding statistical accuracy and efficiency. In this article, trainable and non-trainable combination methods are used for PM10 and PM2.5 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 and 2.5 micrometers, respectively) time series forecasting for eight different locations, in Finland and Brazil, for different periods. Trainable ensembles based on ANNs, linear regression, and Copulas are compared with non-trainable combinations (mean and median), single ANNs, and linear statistical approaches. Different models are considered so far, including Autoregressive model (AR), Autoregressive and Moving Average Model (ARMA), Infinite Impulse Response Filters (IIR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function Networks (RBF), Extreme Learning Machines (ELM), Echo State Networks (ESN), and Adaptive Network Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). The use of ANNs ensembles, mainly combined with MLP, leads to a better one step ahead forecasting performance. The use of robust air pollution forecasting tools is prime to assist governments in managing air pollution issues like hospital collapse during adverse air quality situations. In this sense, our study is indirectly related to the following United Nations sustainable development goals: SDG 3-good health and well-being and SDG 11-sustainable cities and communities. © 2013 IEEE.","artificial neural networks; ensemble; Forecasting; particulate matter","Air quality; Autoregressive moving average model; Diseases; Forecasting; Fuzzy filters; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Health risks; IIR filters; Impulse response; Learning systems; Multilayer neural networks; Public health; Public risks; Radial basis function networks; Sustainable development; Time series analysis; Adaptive network fuzzy inference systems; Air pollution forecasting; Autoregressive and moving average models; Cardiopulmonary disease; Extreme learning machine; Forecasting performance; Particulate matter forecasting; Time series forecasting; Particles (particulate matter)",,,,,"Ebelt, S.T., Wilson, W.E., Brauer, M., Exposure to ambient and nonambient components of particulate matter: A comparison of health effects (2005) Epidemiology, 16 (3), pp. 396-405. , May; Dominici, F., Greenstone, M., Sunstein, C.R., Particulate matter matters (2014) Science, 344 (6181), pp. 257-259. , Apr; Jerrett, M., The death toll from air-pollution sources (2015) Nature, 525 (7569), pp. 330-331. , Sep; (2002) Reducing Risks, Promoting Healthy Life, , https://www.who.int/whr/2002/en/whr02_en.pdf?ua=l, WHO-World Health Organization, [Online]; (2008) Out of 10 People World Wide Breathe Polluted Air, but More Countries Are Taking Action, , http://www.who.int/news-room/detail/02-05-2018-9-out-of-10-people-worldwide-breathe-pollute%d-air-but-more-countries-are-taking-action, WHO-World Health Organization, [Online]; Kassomenos, P., Petrakis, M., Sarigiannis, D., Gotti, A., Karakitsios, S., Identifying the contribution of physical and chemical stressors to the daily number of hospital admissions implementing an artificial neural network model (2011) Air Qual, Atmos.

Unemployment rate prediction of a country is a crucial factor for the country’s economic and financial growth planning and a challenging job for policymakers. Traditional stochastic time series models, as well as modern nonlinear time series techniques, were employed for unemployment rate forecasting previously. These macroeconomic data sets are mostly nonstationary and nonlinear in nature. Thus, it is atypical to assume that an individual time series forecasting model can generate a white noise error. This paper proposes an integrated approach based on linear and nonlinear models that can predict the unemployment rates more accurately. The proposed hybrid model of the unemployment rate can improve their forecasts by reflecting the unemployment rate’s asymmetry. The model’s applications are shown using seven unemployment rate data sets from various countries, namely, Canada, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, and Switzerland. The results of computational tests are very promising in comparison with other conventional methods. The results for asymptotic stationarity of the proposed hybrid approach using Markov chains and nonlinear time series analysis techniques are given in this paper which guarantees that the proposed model cannot show ‘explosive’ behavior or growing variance over time. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","ARIMA model; Asymptotic stationarity; Autoregressive neural networks; Hybrid model; Unemployment rate",,,,,,"Ahmed, N.K., Atiya, A.F., Gayar, N.E., El-Shishiny, H., An empirical comparison of machine learning models for time series forecasting (2010) Econometric Reviews, 29 (5-6), pp. 594-621; Aladag, C.H., Egrioglu, E., Kadilar, C., Forecasting nonlinear time series with a hybrid methodology (2009) Applied Mathematics Letters, 22 (9), pp. 1467-1470; Atsalakis, G., Ucenic, C.I., Skiadas, C., Forecasting unemployment rate using a neural network with fuzzy inference system (2007) ICAP; Blanchard, O.J., Leigh, D., Growth forecast errors and fiscal multipliers (2013) American Economic Review, 103 (3), pp. 117-120; Brockwell, P.J., Lindner, A., Strictly stationary solutions of autoregressive moving average equations (2010) Biometrika, 97 (3), pp. 765-772; Chakraborty, T., Chattopadhyay, S., Ghosh, I., Forecasting dengue epidemics using a hybrid methodology (2019) Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 527 (121), p. 266; Chakraborty, T., Ghosh, I., Real-time forecasts and risk assessment of novel coronavirus (covid-19) cases: A data-driven analysis (2020) Chaos, Solitons and Fractals, 135 (109), p. 850; Chan, K.S., Tong, H., On the use of the deterministic lyapunov function for the ergodicity of stochastic difference equations (1985) Advances in Applied Probability, 17 (3), pp. 666-678; Dumičić, K., Čeh Časni, A., Žmuk, B., Forecasting unemployment rate in selected european countries using smoothing methods (2015) World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology: International Journal of Social, Education, Economics and Management Engineering, 9 (4), pp. 867-872; Edlund, P.O., Karlsson, S., Forecasting the Swedish unemployment rate var vs. transfer function modelling (1993) International Journal of Forecasting, 9 (1), pp. 61-76; Faraway, J., Chatfield, C., Time series forecasting with neural networks: A comparative study using the air line data (1998) Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series C (Applied Statistics), 47 (2), pp. 231-250; Feuerriegel, S., Gordon, J., News-based forecasts of macroeconomic indicators: A semantic path model for interpretable predictions (2019) European Journal of Operational Research, 272 (1), pp. 162-175; Firmino, P.R.A., de Mattos Neto, P.S., Ferreira, T.A., Correcting and combining time series forecasters (2014) Neural Networks, 50, pp. 1-11; Funke, M., Time-series forecasting of the german unemployment rate (1992) Journal of Forecasting, 11 (2), pp. 111-125; Galbraith, J.W., Norden, S., Asymmetry in unemployment rate forecast errors (2019) International Journal of Forecasting; Hyndman, R.J., Athanasopoulos, G., (2018) Forecasting: Principles and Practice, , OTexts; Katris, C., Prediction of unemployment rates with time series and machine learning techniques (2019) Computational Economics, pp. 1-34; Khan Jaffur, Z.R., Sookia, N.U.H., Nunkoo Gonpot, P., Seetanah, B., Out-of-sample forecasting of the Canadian unemployment rates using univariate models (2017) Applied Economics Letters, 24 (15), pp. 1097-1101; Khashei, M., Bijari, M., Which methodology is better for combining linear and nonlinear models for time series forecasting?

Time series forecasting of agricultural products has the basic importance in maintaining the sustainability of agricultural production. The prices of agricultural products show seasonality in their time series, and conventional methods such as the auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA or the Box Jenkins method) have tried to exploit this feature for forecasting. We expect that recurrent neural networks, representing the latest machine learning technology, can forecast future time series better than conventional methods. The measures used in evaluating the forecasted results are also of importance. In literature, the accuracy determined by the error rate at a specific time point in the future, is widely used for evaluation. We predict that, in addition to the error rate, the criterion for conservation of the statistical characteristics of the probability distribution function from the original past time series to the future time series in the forecasted future is also important. This is because some time series have a non-Gaussian probability distribution (such as the Lévy stable distribution) as a characteristic of the target system; for example, market prices on typical days change slightly, however on certain occasions, change dramatically. We implemented two methods for time series forecasting based on recurrent neutral network (RNN), one of which is called time-alignment of time point forecast (TATP), and another one is called direct future time series forecast (DFTS). They were evaluated using the two aforementioned criteria consisting of the accuracy and the conservation of the statistical characteristics of the probability distribution function. We found that after intensive training, TATP of LTSM shows superior performance in not only accuracy, but also the conservation compared to TATP of other RNNs. In DFTS, DFTS of LSTM cannot show the best performance in accuracy in RMS sense, but it shows superior performance in other criteria. The results suggest that the selection of forecasting methods depends on the evaluation criteria and that combinations of forecasting methods is useful based on the application. The advantage of our method is that the required length of time series for training is enough short, namely, we can forecast the whole cycle of future time series after training with even less than the half of the cycle, and it can be applied to the field where enough numbers of continuous data are not available. © 2020, The Author(s).","Lévy distribution;

Prevention plays a key role in these actions plan and, in this context, we propose the use of Artificial Intelligence, specifically Time Series Forecasting techniques, for predicting future outbreaks of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Infection incidence forecasting is approached as a Feature Selection based Time Series Forecasting problem using multivariate time series composed of incidence of Staphylococcus aureus Methicillin-sensible and MRSA infections, influenza incidence and total days of therapy of both of Levofloxacin and Oseltamivir antimicrobials. Data were collected from the University Hospital of Getafe (Spain) from January 2009 to January 2018, using months as time granularity. The main contributions of the work are the following: the applications of wrapper feature selection methods where the search strategy is based on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) along with evaluators based on the most powerful state-of-the-art regression algorithms. The performance of the feature selection methods has been measured using the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) performance metrics. A novel multi-criteria decision-making process is proposed in order to select the most satisfactory forecasting model, using the metrics previously mentioned, as well as the slopes of model prediction lines in the 1, 2 and 3 steps-ahead predictions. The multi-criteria decision-making process is applied to the best models resulting from a ranking of databases and regression algorithms obtained through multiple statistical tests. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a feature selection based multivariate time series methodology is proposed for antibiotic resistance forecasting. Final results show that the best model according to the proposed multi-criteria decision making process provides a RMSE = (0.1349, 0.1304, 0.1325) and a MAE = (0.1003, 0.096, 0.0987) for 1, 2, and 3 steps-ahead predictions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Antibiotic resistance forecasting; Feature selection; Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms; Multiple criteria decision making; Multivariate time series","Antibiotics; Bacteria; Decision making; Evolutionary algorithms; Feature extraction; Mean square error; Staphylococcus aureus; Time series; Antimicrobial resistances; Feature selection methods; Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus; Multi criteria decision making; Multi objective evolutionary algorithms; Multiple statistical tests; Multivariate time series; Time series forecasting; Forecasting; levofloxacin; oseltamivir; antibiotic resistance; Article; deep learning; feature selection; forecasting; influenza; kernel method; mathematical model; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection; multicriteria decision analysis; multiobjective evolutionary algorithm; multivariate analysis; nonhuman; priority journal; support vector machine; time series analysis; antibiotic resistance; artificial intelligence; epidemic; forecasting; human; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; Artificial Intelligence; Disease Outbreaks; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Forecasting; Humans; Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus",,"levofloxacin, 100986-85-4, 138199-71-0; oseltamivir, 196618-13-0, 204255-09-4, 204255-11-8",,,"ECDC/EMEA Joint Technical Report, The bacterial challenge: time to react, Technical Report EMEA/576176/2009 (2009), European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control; European Commission, A European one health action plan against antimicrobial resistance (AMR), Technical report (2017), European Commission; World Health Organization, Global action plan on antimicrobial resistance, Technical Report WHA68/2015/REC/1, Annex 3 (2015), World Health Organization; Tong, S.Y., Davis, J.S., Eichenberger, E., Holland, T.L., Fowler, V.G., Staphylococcus aureus infections: epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and management (2015) Clin Microbiol Rev, 28 (3), pp. 603-661; Rubin, R.J., Harrington, C.A., Ponn, A., Dietrich, K., Greene, J.A., Moiduddin, A., The economic impact of Staphylococcus aureus infection in New York city hospitals (1999) Emerg Infect Dis, 5 (1), pp. 9-17; Kallen, A.J., Brunkard, J., Moore, Z., Budge, P., Arnold, K.E., Fosheim, G., Finelli, L., Gorwitz, R., Staphylococcus aureus community-acquired pneumonia during the 2006 to 2007 influenza season (2009) Ann Emerg Med, 53 (3), pp. 358-365; for Disease Control, C., CDC, P., Severe methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus community-acquired pneumonia associated with influenza-Louisiana and Georgia, December 2006–January 2007 (2007) MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep, 56 (14), p. 325; Köck, R., Becker, K., Cookson, B., van Gemert-Pijnen, J., Harbarth, S., Kluytmans, J., Mielke, M., Struelens, M.J., Systematic literature analysis and review of targeted preventive measures to limit healthcare-associated infections by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (2014) Eurosurveillance, 19 (29); Yamamoto, T., Nishiyama, A., Takano, T., Yabe, S., Higuchi, W., Razvina, O., Shi, D., Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: community transmission, pathogenesis, and drug resistance (2010) J Infect Chemother, 16 (4), pp. 225-254; Guyon, I., Elisseeff, A., An introduction to variable and feature selection (2003) J Mach Learn Res, 3, pp. 1157-1182; Adhikari, R., Agrawal, R.K., An introductory study on time series modeling and forecasting (2013) CoRR abs/1302, 6613. , arXiv:1302.6613; Witten, I.H., Frank, E., Hall, M.A., Data mining: practical machine learning tools and techniques (2011), third ed.

Are the current precautionary measures effective? To answer these questions it is important to forecast regularly and accurately the spread of COVID-19 infections. Different time series forecasting models have been applied in the literature to tackle the pandemic situation. The current research efforts developed few of these models and validates its accuracy for selected countries. It becomes difficult to draw an objective comparison between the performance of these models at a global scale. This is because, the time series trend for the infection differs between the countries depending on the strategies adopted by the healthcare organizations to decrease the spread. Consequently, it is important to develop a tailored model for a country that allows healthcare organizations to better judge the effect of the undertaken precautionary measures, and provision more efficiently the needed resources to face this disease. This paper addresses this void. We develop and compare the performance of the time series models in the literature in terms of root mean squared error and mean absolute percentage error. © 2020 The Author(s)","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Epidemic transmission; Forecasting models; Machine learning models; Pandemic; Time series models","Forecasting; Health care; Mean square error; Coronaviruses; Healthcare organizations; Mean absolute percentage error; Precautionary measures; Research efforts; Root mean squared errors; Time series forecasting models; Time series models; Time series; Article; case study; coronavirus disease 2019; experimental study; forecasting; health care organization; human; long short term memory network; priority journal; short term memory; time series analysis; virus transmission",,,,,"https://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/frequently_asked_questions/pandemic/en/, Who – what is a pandemic?, (Accessed on 06/10/2020); https://covid19.who.int/, Who coronavirus disease (covid-19) dashboard, (Accessed on 06/10/2020); https://www.who.int/ith/diseases/sars/en/, Who – sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome), (Accessed on 06/11/2020); http://www.emro.who.int/pandemic-epidemic-diseases/mers-cov/mers-situation-update-january-2020.html, Who emro – mers situation update, january 2020 – mers-cov – epidemic and pandemic diseases, (Accessed on 06/11/2020); Haber, M.J., Shay, D.K., Davis, X.M., Patel, R., Jin, X., Weintraub, E., Orenstein, E., Thompson, W.W., Effectiveness of interventions to reduce contact rates during a simulated influenza pandemic (2007) Emerging Infectious Diseases, 13 (4), p. 581; https://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/full-news/-/asset_publisher/5X8kX9ePN6CH/content/covid-19-confinement-states-must-step-up-protection-of-children-against-sexual-exploitation-and-abuse-says-lanzarote-committee, Covid-19 confinement: States must step up protection of children against sexual exploitation and abuse says lanzarote committee - (Accessed on 06/10/2020). newsroom; Tandon, H., Ranjan, P., Chakraborty, T., Suhag, V., (2004), Coronavirus (covid-19): Arima based time-series analysis to forecast near future, arXiv preprint arXiv07859; Elmousalami, H.H., Hassanien, A.E., (2003), Day level forecasting for coronavirus disease (covid-19) spread: analysis, modeling and recommendations, arXiv preprint arXiv07778; Petropoulos, F., Makridakis, S., Forecasting the novel coronavirus covid-19 (2020) PloS one, 15 (3); Chimmula, V.K.R., Zhang, L., Time series forecasting of covid-19 transmission in canada using lstm networks (2020) Chaos, Solitons & Fractals; Yonar, H., Yonar, A., Tekindal, M.A., Tekindal, M., Modeling and forecasting for the number of cases of the covid-19 pandemic with the curve estimation models, the box-jenkins and exponential smoothing methods; Jiang, X., Zhao, B.Z., Jinming, C., Statistical analysis on covid-19, Biomedical Journal of Scientific and Technical Research 26 (2); Panda, M., Application of arima and holt-winters forecasting model to predict the spreading of covid-19 for india and its states, medRxiv; Patil, R., Patel, U., Sarkar, T., Covid-19 cases prediction using regression and novel ssm model for non-converged countries (2020) J Appl Sci, Eng, Technol, Educ, 3 (1), pp. 74-81; Ahmar, A.S., del Val, E.B., Suttearima: Short-term forecasting method, a case: Covid-19 and stock market in spain (2020) Sci Total Environ, , 138883; Johnston, F., Boyland, J., Meadows, M., Shale, E., Some properties of a simple moving average when applied to forecasting a time series (1999) J Oper Res Soc, 50 (12), pp. 1267-1271; http://people.duke.edu/rnau/411trend.htm#::text=This%20is%20a%20linear%20trend, Linear trend model for forecasting, equally%20spaced%20sequence%20of%20numbers; Alhassan, E.A., Isaac, A.M., Emmanuel, A., Time series analysis of malaria cases in kasena nankana municipality (2017) Int J Stat Appl, 7 (22), pp. 43-56; Gurbaxani, V., Diffusion in computing networks: the case of bitnet (1990) Commun ACM, 33 (12), pp. 65-75; Ostertagová, E., Ostertag, O., (2011), pp. 380-384. , The simple exponential smoothing model.

Pitágoras 353, Campinas, 13083–857, Brazil","This paper suggests a fuzzy inference system (iFIS) modeling approach for interval-valued time series forecasting. Interval-valued data arise quite naturally in many situations in which such data represent uncertainty/variability or when comprehensive ways to summarize large data sets are required. The method comprises a fuzzy rule-based framework with affine consequents which provides a (non)linear framework that processes interval-valued symbolic data. The iFIS antecedents identification uses a fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm for interval-valued data with adaptive distances, whereas parameters of the linear consequents are estimated with a center-range methodology to fit a linear regression model to symbolic interval data. iFIS forecasting power, measured by accuracy metrics and statistical tests, was evaluated through Monte Carlo experiments using both synthetic interval-valued time series with linear and chaotic dynamics, and real financial interval-valued time series. The results indicate a superior performance of iFIS compared to traditional alternative single-valued and interval-valued forecasting models by reducing 19% on average the predicting errors, indicating that the suggested approach can be considered as a promising tool for interval time series forecasting. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Fuzzy inference systems; Interval-valued data; Rule-based models; Symbolic data analysis; Time series forecasting","Clustering algorithms; Forecasting; Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy systems; Linear regression; Time series; Time series analysis; Fuzzy inference systems; Interval-valued data; Rule-based models; Symbolic data analysis; Time series forecasting; Fuzzy inference",,,,,"Zhou, L., Pan, S., Wang, J., Vasilakos, A.V., Machine learning on big data: Opportunities and challenges (2017) Neurocomputing, 237, pp. 350-361; Conde-Clemente, P., Trivino, G., Alonso, J.M., Generating automatic linguistic descriptions with big data (2017) Inform.

In previous studies, the CCI was forecasted using the time-series analysis methods. However, the effects of specific intervening factors such as economic recession and policy changes on the CCI data were neglected, thus compromising the reliability and accuracy of the forecast models. In this study, an interrupted time-series forecasting model was developed wherein the economic recession of 2008 was reflected in the forecasting model, which is an outlier identified to have significant impact on the CCI. The forecast result obtained using the interrupted timeseries forecasting model was better than that using the conventional forecast models such as the ARIMA and Holt–Winters exponential-smoothing models. The accurately forecasted CCI using the presented model will help in budget and bid planning as well as assessing the risk of future businesses. © 2018, Korean Society of Civil Engineers.","Construction Cost Index (CCI); forecast; interrupted time-series; intervention analysis; outlier detection","Budget control; Cost benefit analysis; Cost engineering; Costs; Forecasting; Risk assessment; Statistics; Construction cost indices; Construction projects; Engineering news records; Intervention analysis; Outlier Detection; Time series forecasting; Time series forecasting models; Winters exponential smoothing; Time series analysis",,,,,"Ashuri, B., Lu, J., Forecasting ENR construction cost index: A time series analysis approach (2010) Construction Research Congress 2010; Ashuri, B., Shahandashti, S.M., Lu, J., Empirical tests for identifying leading indicators of ENR Construction Cost Index (2012) Construction Management and Economics, 30 (11), pp. 917-927; Bai, J., Least squares estimation of a shift in linear processes (1994) Journal of Time Series Analysis, 15 (5), pp. 453-472; (1975) Journal of the American Statistical Association, 70 (349); Chang, I., Outliers in time series (1982) Technical Report.

Getúlio Vargas, 04, Monte Castelo, CEP: 65030-005, São Luís-MA, Brazil","This paper proposes a new methodology for modelling based on an evolving Neuro-Fuzzy Takagi–Sugeno (NF-TS) network used for seasonal time series forecasting. The NF-TS considers the unobservable components extracted from the time series data to evolve, that is, to adapt and to adjust its structure, where the fuzzy rules number of this network can increase or decrease according to components behaviour. The method used to extract these components is a recursive version, proposed in this paper, based on the Spectral Singular Analysis (SSA) technique. The NF-TS network adopts the principle divide to conquer, where it divides a complex problem into subproblems easier to deal, forecasting separately each unobservable component, because they present dynamic behaviours that are simpler to forecast. The consequent propositions of fuzzy rules are linear state space models, where the states are the unobservable components data. When there are available observations from the time series, the training stage of NF-TS is performed, i.e., the NF-TS evolves its structure and adapts its parameters to carry out the mapping between the components data and the available sample of original time series. On the other hand, if this observation is not available, the network considers the forecasting stage, keeping its structure fixed and using the states of consequent fuzzy rules to feedback the unobservable components data to NF-TS. The NF-TS was evaluated and compared with other recent and traditional techniques for seasonal time series forecasting, obtaining competitive and advantageous results in relation to other papers. This paper also presents a case study about real-time detection of anomalies based on a patient electrocardiogram data. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Evolving systems; Forecasting; Neuro-fuzzy modelling; Seasonal time series; Singular spectral analysis; Unobservable components","Complex networks; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy rules; Spectrum analysis; State space methods; Time series; Dynamic behaviours; Evolving systems; Linear state space model; Neuro-fuzzy modelling; Real-time detection; Seasonal time series; Traditional techniques; Unobservable; Time series analysis",,,,,"Abdollahzade, M., Miranian, A., Hassani, H., Iranmanesh, H., A new hybrid enhanced local linear neuro-fuzzy model based on the optimized singular spectrum analysis and its application for nonlinear and chaotic time series forecasting (2015) Inform.

The prediction of noisy, non-stationary, and chaotic time series demands good generalization from small amounts of data. Vapnik showed that the total risk is dependent on both, empirical error as well as model complexity, where the latter may be measured in terms of the Vapnik–Chervonenkis (VC) dimension. In other words, good generalization requires minimizing model complexity. The recently proposed Minimal Complexity Machine (MCM) has been shown to minimize a tight bound on the VC dimension, and has further been extended to Minimal Complexity Machine Regression (MCMR). In this paper, we present an original approach based on the MCM regressor, which builds sparse and accurate models for short-term time series forecasting. Results on a number of datasets establish that the proposed approach is superior to a number of state-of-the-art methods, and yields sparse models. These sparse models are able to extract only the most important information present in the data sets, thereby achieving high accuracy. Sparsity in time series forecasting models is also important in reducing the evaluation time. This assumes importance when the models need to be evaluated in real time, such as when they are used as part of trading flows. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","MCMR; Neural Networks; Regression; Short Term Forecasting; Support Vector Machines; Time Series Forecasting","Big data; Complex networks; Forecasting; Neural networks; Risk assessment; Support vector machines; Time series; Chaotic time series; MCMR; Model complexity; Regression; Short-term forecasting; Time series forecasting; Time series forecasting models; Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimensions; Time series analysis; Article; artificial neural network; back propagation; classifier; computer prediction; data analysis; forecasting; machine learning; minimal complexity machine regression; support vector machine; time series analysis; time series forecasting",,,,,"Tang, Z., de Almeida, C., Fishwick, P.A., Time series forecasting using neural networks vs. Box–Jenkins methodology (1991) Simulation, 57 (5), pp. 303-310; Cortez, P., Rocha, M., Neves, J., Evolving time series forecasting ARMA models (2004) J.

To that aim, a lot of job boards websites have been created, for disseminating and sharing at the best the job offers. Choosing the relevant job board for the broadcasting of a given job offer can be sometimes difficult for the recruiters, since they always seek to attract the best candidates, in a short period of time. Moreover, some job boards have different business categories, which can make the selection very difficult. To deal with these problems, we propose in this paper, Smart4Job a new job boards recommendation system, which proposes the adequate job boards for the dissemination of a new job offer. Our system is based on a hybrid representation on a big data platform, which includes both a domain knowledge analysis and a temporal prediction model. The semantic classification of job boards requires a textual analysis using a controlled vocabulary. The time series analysis module is used to predict the best job board for a given offer, using the history of the clicks. The answers of these modules are combined during the decision making process. The proposed system has been evaluated on real data, and preliminary results seem very promising. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Big data; Classification; Data mining; Information retrieval; Recommendation; Time series forecasting",,,,,,"chung Fu, T., A review on time series data mining (2011) Eng.

This allows management to estimate the failure rate of the system in field use, and to set release criteria based on these forecasts. However, the current software reliability growth models have never proven to be accurate enough for widespread industry use. One possible reason is that the model forms themselves may not accurately capture the underlying process of fault injection in software; it has been suggested that fault injection is better modeled as a chaotic process rather than a random one. This possibility, while intriguing, has not yet been evaluated in large-scale, modern software reliability growth datasets. We report on an analysis of four software reliability growth datasets, including ones drawn from the Android and Mozilla open-source software communities. These are the four largest software reliability growth datasets we are aware of in the public domain, ranging from 1200 to over 86,000 observations. We employ the methods of nonlinear time series analysis to test for chaotic behavior in these time series; we find that three of the four do show evidence of such behavior (specifically, a multifractal attractor). Finally, we compare a deterministic time series forecasting algorithm against a statistical one on both datasets, to evaluate whether exploiting the apparent chaotic behavior might lead to more accurate reliability forecasts. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Chaos theory; Forecasting; Machine learning; Software reliability; Time series analysis","Artificial intelligence; Chaos theory; Computer software; Failure analysis; Forecasting; Harmonic analysis; Learning systems; Open source software; Open systems; Reliability; Reliability analysis; Reliability theory; Software engineering; Software testing; Time series analysis; Chaotic behaviors; Deterministic chaos; Nonlinear time-series analysis; Open source software community; Release criteria; Software reliability growth; Software reliability growth models; Time series forecasting; Software reliability",,,,,"Beran, J., Statistics for Long-Memory Processes (1994), CRC Press Boca Raton, FL, USA; Bollerslev, T., Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (1986) J.

While most of the research is focused on the development and improvement of novel discrete-time models, very limited attention has been paid to the relationships among diverse models. The current paper proposes a methodological and practical framework to unify the single-variable, multi-variable, and multi-output discrete-time grey models, making it easier for practitioners to select an appropriate model for a given time-series forecasting problem. The recursive extrapolation strategy is present to generate multi-step ahead forecasts and four model families are deduced within the universal framework. Large-scale simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the finite-sample fitting and multi-step ahead forecasting performance. The proposed approach is illustrated using application examples from the indirect measurement of the tensile strength of materials. © 2020 ISA","discrete-time grey model; Grey system model; indirect measurement;

At the core of this framework is nonlinear dynamic generative modeling of time series using the Koopman operator which is an infinite-dimensional but linear operator. Rather than working with the underlying nonlinear model, we propose two simpler linear representations or model forms based on Koopman spectral properties. We show that these model forms are invariants of the generative model and can be readily identified directly from data using techniques for computing Koopman spectral properties without requiring the explicit knowledge of the generative model. We also introduce different notions of distances on the space of such model forms which is essential for model comparison/clustering. We employ the space of Koopman model forms equipped with distance in conjunction with classical machine learning techniques to develop a framework for automatic feature generation for time series classification. The forecasting/anomaly detection framework is based on using Koopman model forms along with classical linear systems and control approaches. We demonstrate the proposed framework for human activity classification, and for time series forecasting/anomaly detection in power grid application. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Dynamical Systems and Control; Koopman operator; Machine learning; Nonlinear time series modeling and analysis","Anomaly detection; Computation theory; Dynamical systems; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Learning systems; Linear systems; Machine learning; Mathematical operators; Time series; Interdisciplinary frameworks; Koopman operator; Machine learning techniques; Non-linear time-series models; Systems and control; Systems and control theory; Time series classifications; Time series forecasting; Time series analysis",,,,,"Afsari, B., Vidal, R., The alignment distance on spaces of linear dynamical systems (2013) 52Nd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, pp. 1162-1167. , pp; Ali, S., Basharat, A., Shah, M., Chaotic invariants for human action recognition (2007) 2007 IEEE 11Th International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 1-8. , IEEE; Anguita, D., Ghio, A., Oneto, L., Parra, X., Reyes-Ortiz, J.L., Human activity recognition on smartphones using a multiclass hardware-friendly support vector machine (2012) International Workshop on Ambient Assisted Living, pp. 216-223. , Springer, Berlin; Anguita, D., Ghio, A., Oneto, L., Parra, X., Reyes-Ortiz, J.L., (2013) A Public Domain Dataset for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones, , ESANN; Atzori, L., Iera, A., Morabito, G., The internet of things: a survey (2010) Comput.

Time-series models can be linear, like linear state-space models or non-linear, like artificial neural networks. One way to judge the goodness of different models associated with a given time-series is to assess the prediction capabilities of these models. Some of the important techniques used in time-series forecasting are: (i) Minimum mean squared error (MMSE) forecast obtained using conditional means of ARIMA(p,d,q) models, (ii) Kalman filter approach and (iii) Artificial neural networks (ANN) approach. However, the wavelet-based versions of these techniques, respectively denoted as W-MMSE, W-Kalman and W-ANN, rather than the original techniques themselves, have been found to possess better capabilities in forecasting the highly nonlinear geophysical data. Using the original and predicted data, these observations have been validated by determining the RMSE (root mean squared error) and correlation coefficients between them. The prediction capabilities of both versions of the above techniques are tested on (i) the ionospheric total electron content (TEC) data, (ii) the daily average rainfall data and (iii) the gamma-ray log data from an offshore oil well, off the west coast of India. The TEC and daily average rainfall data sets designate as examples of data with very high correlations pertaining over very large lags. They also have a strong seasonality component associated with them. However, the gamma-ray log data sets show no seasonality component and have no trends associated with them. Therefore, the choice of different nonlinear data sets having diverse sources of their origins are apt to test the forecasting capabilities of these techniques. It has been observed that W-ANN gives the best prediction, when compared with the other algorithms discussed in this paper. This is believed to be due to the use of non-linear activation function by ANNs to produce regression that results in capturing the inherent non-linear dynamics of the process effectively. The results also show the usefulness of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coefficients as training features for both linear and non-linear forecasting approaches. The better performance of the wavelet-based forecasting algorithms can be attributed to the fact that DWT coefficients are wide-sense stationary sequences. Thus the wavelet-based versions of these models like W-MMSE and W-Kalman provide better fit to these coefficients, compared to the original time-series data itself. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","ARIMA models; Artificial neural networks; Kalman filter algorithm; Time-series forecasting; Wavelet transform","Discrete wavelet transforms; Gamma rays; Geophysics; Ionosphere; Kalman filters; Mean square error; Neural networks; Offshore oil well production; Offshore oil wells; Oil well logging; Radioactivity logging; Rain; Signal reconstruction; State space methods; Time series; Wavelet transforms; ARIMA models; Ionospheric total electron content; Kalman filter algorithms; Linear state space model; Minimum mean squared error; Nonlinear activation functions; Root mean squared errors; Time series forecasting; Forecasting; artificial neural network; comparative study; error analysis; forecasting method; Kalman filter; time series analysis; total electron content; transform; wavelet analysis; India",,,,,"Akaike, H., Fitting autoregressive models for prediction (1969) Ann.

The container throughput data are complex and often have multiple seasonality. This makes it difficult to forecast accurately. The purpose of this paper is to forecast container throughput using deep learning methods and benchmark its performance over other traditional time-series methods. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are implemented to forecast container throughput. The container throughput data of the Port of Singapore are used for empirical analysis. The forecasting performance of the LSTM model is compared with seven different time-series forecasting methods, namely, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), simple exponential smoothing, Holt–Winter’s, error-trend-seasonality, trigonometric regressors (TBATS), neural network (NN) and ARIMA + NN. The relative error matrix is used to analyze the performance of the different models with respect to bias, accuracy and uncertainty. Findings: The results showed that LSTM outperformed all other benchmark methods. From a statistical perspective, the Diebold–Mariano test is also conducted to further substantiate better forecasting performance of LSTM over other counterpart methods. Originality/value: The proposed study is a contribution to the literature on the container throughput forecasting and adds value to the supply chain theory of forecasting. Second, this study explained the architecture of the deep-learning-based LSTM method and discussed in detail the steps to implement it. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Deep learning; Forecasting;

In time series analysis, forecasting is the vital area of study besides other meaningful characteristics of the data. It has vast application in decision-making and prediction in the domain of economics, agriculture, medicine, industries, energy sector and other sciences. Fuzzy time series emerged as a robust tool to cater for historical data in linguistic values. This paper proposes the new method of fuzzy time series forecasting based on the approach of fuzzy clustering and information granules integrated with the weighted average approach to deal with the uncertainty in data series. To distinguish the power of modeling and prediction, the strategies of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are utilized as a criterion. Findings illustrate that proposed fuzzy based time series approach is vigorous to compute the accurate estimates. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

Operators are eager to know the behavior of mobile networks and the real-time experience of users, which requires the using of historical data to accurately predict future network conditions. Big data analysis and computing which is widely adopted can be used as a solution. However, there are still some challenges in data analysis and prediction for mobile network optimization, such as the timeliness and accuracy of the prediction. This paper proposes a traffic analysis and prediction system which is suitable for urban wireless communication networks by combining actual call detail record (CDR) data analysis and multivariate prediction algorithms. Firstly, a spatial-temporal modeling is used for historical traffic data extracting. After that, causality analysis is applied to communication data analysis for the first time. Based on causal analysis, multivariate long short-term memory models are used to predict future data for CDR data. Finally, the prediction algorithm is used to process real data of different scenes in the city to verify the performance of the entire system. © 2019, The Author(s).","Causality analysis; CDR; LSTM multivariate time series forecasting; Spatial-temporal modeling","Clock and data recovery circuits (CDR circuits); Data handling; Forecasting; Information analysis; Mobile telecommunication systems; Multivariant analysis; Telecommunication networks; Time series analysis; Wireless networks; Call detail records; Causality analysis; Mobile network optimizations; Multivariate time series; Operation and maintenance; Prediction algorithms; Spatial temporal model; Wireless communication network; Long short-term memory",,,,,"Wang, Z., Zhang, S., (2016) 2016 IEEE 14Th Intl Conf on Dependable, Autonomic & Secure Computing, 14Th Intl Conf on Pervasive Intelligence & Computing, 2Nd Intl Conf on Big Data Intelligence & Computing & Cyber Science & Technology Congress (Dasc/Picom/Datacom/Cyberscitech).

The approach is based on continuously adjusting an initial forecasting model to asymptotically approximate a desired time series model. First, a predictive model generates an initial forecasting for a time series. Second, a residual time series is calculated as the difference between the original time series and the initial forecasting. If that residual series is not white noise, then it can be used to improve the accuracy of the initial model and a new predictive model is adjusted using residual series. The whole process is repeated until convergence or the residual series becomes white noise. The output of the method is then given by summing up the outputs of all trained predictive models in a perturbative sense. To test the method, an experimental investigation was conducted on six real world time series. A comparison was made with six other methods experimented and ten other results found in the literature. Results show that not only the performance of the initial model is significantly improved but also the proposed method outperforms the other results previously published. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial neural networks; Combination of forecasts; Perturbation theory; Time series forecasting","Forecasting; Neural networks; Time series; White noise; Experimental investigations; Forecasting modeling; Perturbation theory; Perturbative approach; Real-world time series; Time series forecasting; Time series modeling; Time series prediction; Perturbation techniques; Article; artificial neural network; forecasting; intermethod comparison; mathematical computing; mathematical phenomena; measurement accuracy; pertubation theory; prediction; simulation; time series analysis; white noise; epidemiology; forecasting; human; procedures; theoretical model; Forecasting; Humans; Interrupted Time Series Analysis; Models, Theoretical; Neural Networks (Computer)",,,,,"Abdollahzade, M., Miranian, A., Hassani, H., Iranmanesh, H., A new hybrid enhanced local linear neuro-fuzzy model based on the optimized singular spectrum analysis and its application for nonlinear and chaotic time series forecasting (2015) Information Sciences, 295, pp. 107-125; Ardalani-Farsa, M., Zolfaghari, S., Chaotic time series prediction with residual analysis method using hybrid Elman-NARX neural networks (2010) Neurocomputing, 73 (13-15), pp. 2540-2553. , Pattern Recognition in Bioinformatics Advances in Neural Control; Arnaiz-González, A., Blachnik, M., Kordos, M., García-Osorio, C., Fusion of instance selection methods in regression tasks (2016) Information Fusion, 30, pp. 69-79; Assaad, M., Boné, R., Cardot, H., A new boosting algorithm for improved time-series forecasting with recurrent neural networks (2008) Information Fusion, 9 (1), pp. 41-55. , Special Issue on Applications of Ensemble Methods; Babu, C.N., Reddy, B.E., A moving-average filter based hybrid ARIMA-ANN model for forecasting time series data (2014) Applied Soft Computing, 23, pp. 27-38; Bianchi, F.M., Scardapane, S., Uncini, A., Rizzi, A., Sadeghian, A., Prediction of telephone calls load using echo state network with exogenous variables (2015) Neural Networks, 71, pp. 204-213; Box, G.E.P., Jenkins, G.M., Reinsel, G.C., Time series analysis: forecasting and control (2008), 4th ed.

The data-driven forecasting model can help a better understanding of environmental air quality. The existing data-driven forecasting models usually ignore missing values, the correlations between the pollutant and meteorological factors and fail to perform temporal modeling effectively, affecting prediction accuracy. In response to these issues, we present a deep learning-based Convolutional LSTM–SDAE (CLS) model to forecast the particulate matter level, revealing the correlation between particulate matter and meteorological factors. In the proposed architecture, the k nearest neighbor (KNN) imputation technique is employed to recover the air quality dataset's missing values. The Convolutional Long Short Term Memory (CNN–LSTM) unit identifies the vast dataset's hidden features and performs pollutants’ temporal modeling. In addition, Bidirectional Gatted Recurrent Unit (BIGRU) is implemented as both encoder and decoder in Sparse Denoising Autoencoder, which reconstructs the CNN–LSTM model's output in the dynamic fine-tuning layer to get robust prediction results. The experimental results in Talcher, India, and Beijing, China indicate that the model can improve forecasting accuracy and outperforms the other state of art and baseline models. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Convolutional LSTM;

The forecasting of different types of energy consumption, especially small-sample forecasting, has been a challenging task because of the limitation of the sample size. Thus, in this study, a novel forecasting system based on fuzzy time series that is appropriate for small-sample forecasting was developed. Specifically, the fuzzy time series, which deals with the fuzzy set, is applied as the forecasting program. In fuzzy time series forecasting, the information granularity and fuzzy c-means clustering are utilized for fuzzification. Moreover, an improved chaotic electromagnetic field optimization algorithm is applied to search for the optimal parameters of the information granularity. The experiments and comparison verified that the proposed forecasting system has an excellent performance in energy consumption forecasting with great accuracy and stability, providing accurate forecasting for the energy consumption structure. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Energy consumption structure; Fuzzy time series; Improved optimization algorithm; Information granularity","Electromagnetic fields; Energy utilization; Information granules; Sustainable development; Time series; Energy consumption structure; Field optimization; Forecasting system; Fuzzy C means clustering; Fuzzy time series; Hybrid forecasting; Information granularity; Optimal parameter; Forecasting; accuracy assessment; comparative study; detection method; electromagnetic field; forecasting method; optimization; sustainable development; time series analysis",,,,,"Wu, H., Xu, L., Ren, S., Hao, Y., Yan, G., How do energy consumption and environmental regulation affect carbon emissions in China?

While many variations of attention have been developed over recent years, all share a common component in the application of a softmax function to normalize the attention weights, in order to transform them into valid mixing coefficients. In this paper, we aim to improve the modeling flexibility of a generic attention module by innovatively replacing this softmax operation with a learnable softmax, in which the normalizing functions are also adapted from the data. Specifically, our generalized softmax builds upon recent work in learning activation functions for deep networks, in particular the kernel activation function and its extensions. We describe the application of the proposed technique for the challenging case of time series forecasting with the dual-stage attention-based recurrent neural network (DA-RNN), an innovative model for predicting time series that employs two different attention modules for handling exogenous factors and long-term dependencies. A series of real-world benchmarks are used to show that simply plugging-in our generalized attention model can improve results on all datasets, even when keeping the number of trainable parameters in the model constant. To further evaluate the algorithm, we collect a novel dataset for predicting the Bitcoin closing exchange rate, a problem of high practical significance lately. Finally, to foster research in the topic, we also release both the dataset and our model as an open source extensible library. Over a baseline DA-RNN, our proposed model delivers an improvement of MAR ranging from 6% to 15% using our newly-released dataset. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Activation function; Attention; Softmax; Time series forecasting","Chemical activation; Deep learning; Forecasting; Time series; Activation functions; Attention; Extensible library; Long-term dependencies; Machine translations; Modeling flexibility; Softmax; Time series forecasting; Recurrent neural networks; article; attention; forecasting; learning; recurrent neural network; time series analysis",,,,,"Agostinelli, F., Hoffman, M., Sadowski, P., Baldi, P., (2014), Learning activation functions to improve deep neural networks, arXiv:; Alessandretti, L., ElBahrawy, A., Aiello, L.M., Baronchelli, A., Anticipating cryptocurrency prices using machine learning (2018) Complexity, 2018; Amjad, U., Jilani, T.A., Tariq, H., Hussain, A., A quantum based evolutionary algorithm for stock index and bitcoin price forecasting (2018) Int.

Different models have been proposed to predict fire activity, which can be classified into global and regional ones. Global fire models focus on longer timescale simulations and can be very complex. Regional fire models concentrate on seasonal forecasting but usually require inputs that are not available in many places. Motivated by the possibility of having a simple, fast, and general model, we propose a seasonal fire prediction methodology based on time series forecasting methods. It consists of dividing the studied area into grid cells and extracting time series of fire counts to fit the forecasting models. We apply these models to estimate the fire season severity (FSS) from each cell, here defined as the sum of the fire counts detected in a season. Experimental results using a global fire detection data set show that the proposed approach can predict FSS with a relatively low error in many regions. The proposed approach is reasonably fast and can be applied on a global scale. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Fire season length; Fire severity; Global fire activity; Time series prediction; Wildfire","Climate change; Forecasting; Time series; Fire severity; Forecasting models; Global fire; Seasonal forecasting; Time series forecasting; Time series prediction; Time-scale simulation; Wildfire; Fires; climate change; data set; experimental study; fire management; severe weather; time series analysis; weather forecasting; wildfire",,,,,"Andela, N., Morton, D.C., Giglio, L., Chen, Y., van der Werf, G.R., Kasibhatla, P.S., DeFries, R.S., Randerson, J.T., A human-driven decline in global burned area (2017) Science, 356, pp. 1356-1362; Arora, V.K., Melton, J.R., Reduction in global area burned and wildfire emissions since 1930s enhances carbon uptake by land (2018) Nature Commun., 9, p. 1326; Arroyo, L.A., Pascual, C., Manzanera, J.A., Fire models and methods to map fuel types: The role of remote sensing (2008) Forest Ecol.

The dynamics become very complex of epidemics in sweeping population. Efficient descriptive, predictive, preventive and prescriptive analyses on the huge data generated by SMAC are very crucial for valuable arrangement and associated responsive tactics. In this paper, we have proposed the use of machine learning techniques for performance evaluation of time series forecasting of Ebola casualties. By experimenting without lag creation, we achieved the best results in the MAE of 7.85%, RMSE value of 61.14%, and Direction Accuracy of 85.99% with Random Tree Classifier. Thus we can conclude that by using these models for forecasting epidemic spread and developing public health policies leads the health authorities to ensure the appropriate actions for the control of the outbreak. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.","Ebola; Epidemic Forecasting; SMAC; Time series forecasting Random tree","Disease control; Diseases; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Time series; Time series analysis; Ebola; Machine learning techniques; Performance analysis; Public health policies; Random tree; SMAC; State-of-art technology; Time series forecasting; Machine learning",,,,,"Pyne, S., Vullikanti, A.K.S., Marathe, M.V., Big Data applications in health sciences and epidemiology (2015) Handbook of Statistics, 33, pp. 171-202. , ISSN 0169-7161; (2018) Ebola Virus Disease: Fact Sheet, , http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/; Last, J., (2001) A Dictionary of Epidemiology, , 4th edn.

This important phenomenon, known as the cumulative effect, would lead to relatively large forecasting errors. In this paper, the dynamic similar sub-series method is proposed to take cumulative effect into consideration. The similar sub-series for the forecasting parameter sub-series are selected based on similarities of target parameter sub-series and influencing factors sub-series. The internal variations of target parameter sub-series and each influencing factor sub-series are innovatively integrated into the selection rules for the dynamic similar sub-series. The corresponding forecasting algorithm is designed, and the forecasting parameters are deduced and forecasted according to the variation of the dynamic similar sub-series. The proposed method is compared with a variety of representative methods under the short-term daily average load forecasting, the electricity price forecasting and the global horizontal irradiance forecasting scenarios to demonstrate its effectiveness. © 2018 IEEE.","cumulative effect; electricity price; Forecasting method; short-term daily average load; time series","Forecasting; Glass fiber reinforced plastics; Time series; Time series analysis; Cumulative effects; Electricity price forecasting; Electricity prices; Forecasting algorithm; Forecasting error; Forecasting methods; Short term; Time series forecasting; Electric load forecasting",,,,,"Fan, S., Chen, L., Short-term load forecasting based on an adaptive hybrid method (2006) IEEE Trans.

There has been a lot of interest in using GP to tackle forecasting problems. Unfortunately, it is not clear whether GP can outperform traditional forecasting techniques such as auto-regressive models. In this contribution, we present a comparison between standard GP systems qand auto-regressive integrated moving average model and exponential smoothing. This comparison points out particular configurations of GP that are competitive against these forecasting techniques. In addition to this, we propose a novel technique to select a forecaster from a collection of predictions made by different GP systems. The result shows that this selection scheme is competitive with traditional forecasting techniques, and, in a number of cases it is statistically better. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2016.","Auto-regressive models; Genetic programming; M1 and M3 competitions; Time series forecasting","Algorithms; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Signal encoding; Time series; Time series analysis; Auto regressive integrated moving average models; Auto regressive models; Exponential smoothing; Forecasting problems; Forecasting techniques; Novel techniques; Selection scheme; Time series forecasting; Genetic programming; forecasting; genetic model; model; prediction; time series analysis",,,,,"Agapitos, A., Oneill, M., Brabazon, A., Genetic programming for the induction of seasonal forecasts: A study on weather derivatives (2012) Financial Decision Making Using Computational Intelligence, 70, pp. 159-188. , Doumpos M, Zopounidis C, Pardalos PM, springer optimization and its applications.

As one of the effective forecast methods, machine learning (ML) methods are employed for wind speed time series forecasting because the excellent ability in fitting the relationship between data and cost function. However, the cost functions with non-convexity make the whole problem poor interpretability and poor robustness. In this paper, a novel hybrid supervised approach is proposed to solve the above problems. The proposed approach has adopted local convolutional neural networks (LCNNs) for convexity preserving of the cost function, in this way, a non-convex problem can be transformed as a convex problem so that heuristic optimization algorithms is adopted to find optimal parameters, and it helps to construct a more stable model. Highway Gate (HG) algorithm is adopted to decrease the computation complexity of the proposed model. The numerical simulation results indicate that the proposed method is not only effective for solving convergence problem cost by non-convexity, but also beneficial to improve accuracy and stability of the traditional ML for wind speed time series forecasting. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Convolutional neural networks;

In order to improve the quality of life of people with diabetes and reduce the occurrence of complications, it is fundamental to prevent glycemic levels from exceeding the physiologic range. With this purpose, many works in recent years have been developed to forecast future glycemic trends using machine learning algorithms that exploit the reading of continuous glucose monitoring sensors, which gather glycemic data from diabetic patients 24 h a day. However, their application is limited in practice by the fact that they usually require a large amount of training data and other heterogeneous features gathered from patients. For this reason, in this work we present a novel neural network capable of predicting future glycemic levels using only the past glucose values as input while needing a small amount of training data. The model is a jump neural network with the addition of feedback connections from the output to the hidden layer, and time delays for each of the input-to-hidden, output-to-hidden and input-to-output connections. Experiments were conducted on a private and a public dataset. We evaluated performance in terms of RMSE and of adverse event detection. The proposed model outperforms other methods suited for time series forecasting, as well as models for blood glucose level prediction present in the literature. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bio-medical patterns; Diabetes; Neural networks; Precision medicine; Time series forecasting","Blood; Forecasting; Glucose; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Time delay; Time series analysis; Blood glucose level; Continuous glucose monitoring sensors; Diabetes mellitus; Diabetic patient; Feedback connection; Heterogeneous features; Novel neural network; Time series forecasting; Multilayer neural networks",,,,,"Stratton, I.M., Association of glycaemia with macrovascular and microvascular complications of type 2 diabetes (ukpds 35): prospective observational study (2000) Bmj, 321 (7258), pp. 405-412; Diabetes (2019), http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs312/en/, online, URL; Bunescu, R., Struble, N., Marling, C., Shubrook, J., Schwartz, F., Blood glucose level prediction using physiological models and support vector regression (2013) 12th Int.

However, the performance of DL models can degenerate rapidly if the data are not appropriately normalized. This issue is even more apparent when DL is used for financial time series forecasting tasks, where the nonstationary and multimodal nature of the data pose significant challenges and severely affect the performance of DL models. In this brief, a simple, yet effective, neural layer that is capable of adaptively normalizing the input time series, while taking into account the distribution of the data, is proposed. The proposed layer is trained in an end-to-end fashion using backpropagation and leads to significant performance improvements compared to other evaluated normalization schemes. The proposed method differs from traditional normalization methods since it learns how to perform normalization for a given task instead of using a fixed normalization scheme. At the same time, it can be directly applied to any new time series without requiring retraining. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using a large-scale limit order book data set, as well as a load forecasting data set. © 2012 IEEE.","Data normalization; deep learning (DL); limit order book data; time series forecasting","Correlation theory; Deep learning; Financial data processing; Forecasting; End to end; Financial time series forecasting; Limit order book; Load forecasting; Multi-modal; Nonstationary; Normalization methods; Time series forecasting; Time series analysis; article; back propagation; deep learning; forecasting; time series analysis",,,,,"Kim, K.J., Financial time series forecasting using support vector machines (2003) Neurocomputing, 55 (1-2), pp. 307-319. , Sep; Miranian, A., Abdollahzade, M., Developing a local least-squares support vector machines-based neuro-fuzzy model for nonlinear and chaotic time series prediction (2013) Ieee Trans.

Wrong crude oil price forecasts can bring huge losses to governments, enterprises, investors and even cause economic and social instability. Many classic econometrics and computational approaches show good performance for the ordinary time series prediction tasks, but not satisfactory in crude oil price predictions. They ignore the characteristics of non-linearity and non-stationarity of crude oil prices data, which hinder an accurate prediction and eventually lead to poor accuracy or the wrong result. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and ensemble EMD (EEMD) solve the problems of non-stationary time series forecasting, but they also generate new problems of mode mixing and reconstruction errors. We propose a hybrid method that is combination of the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and multi-layer gated recurrent unit (ML-GRU) neural network to solve the abovementioned issues. This not only deals with the issue of mode mixing effectively, but also makes the reconstruction error of data close to zero. Multi-layer GRU has an excellent ability of nonlinear data-fitting. The experimental results of real WTI crude oil dataset show that the proposed approach perform better in crude oil prices forecasts than some state-of-the-art models. © 2020 by the authors.

The main aim of time series forecasting is to obtain reasonably accurate forecasts of future data from analyzing records of data. In the paper, we proposed an ensemble-based forecast combination methodology as an alternative approach to forecasting methods for time series prediction. The ensemble learning technique combines various learning algorithms, including SOGA (structure optimization genetic algorithm)-based FCMs, RCGA (real coded genetic algorithm)-based FCMs, efficient and adaptive ANNs architectures, and a hybrid structure of FCM-ANN, recently proposed for time series forecasting. All ensemble algorithms execute according to the one-step prediction regime. The particular forecast combination approach was specifically selected due to the advanced features of each ensemble component, where the findings of this work evinced the effectiveness of this approach, in terms of prediction accuracy, when compared against other well-known, independent forecasting approaches, such as ANNs or FCMs, and the long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm as well. The suggested ensemble learning approach was applied to three distribution points that compose the natural gas grid of a Greek region. For the evaluation of the proposed approach, a real-time series dataset for natural gas prediction was used. We also provided a detailed discussion on the performance of the individual predictors, the ensemble predictors, and their combination through two well-known ensemble methods (the average and the error-based) that are characterized in the literature as particularly accurate and effective. The prediction results showed the efficacy of the proposed ensemble learning approach, and the comparative analysis demonstrated enough evidence that the approach could be used effectively to conduct forecasting based on multivariate time series. © 2019 by the authors.","Ensemble learning; Fuzzy cognitive maps; Machine learning; Natural gas; Neural networks; Prediction; Time series forecasting","Cognitive systems; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy rules; Genetic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Natural gas; Neural networks; Structural optimization; Time series; Ensemble learning; Ensemble learning approach; Ensemble-based forecasts; Fuzzy cognitive map; Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs); Multivariate time series; Real coded genetic algorithm; Time series forecasting; Time series analysis",,,,,"Li, H.Z., Guo, S., Li, C.J., Sun, J.Q., A hybrid annual power load forecasting model based on generalized regression neural network with fruit fly optimization algorithm (2013) Knowl.-Based Syst, 37, pp. 378-387; Bodyanskiy, Y., Popov, S., Neural network approach to forecasting of quasiperiodic financial time series (2006) Eur.

The electricity load from consumers is simply aggregated or optimally clustered to more predictable groups by cluster analysis. The clustering approach consists of efficient preprocessing of data obtained from smart meters by a model-based representation and the K-means method. We have implemented two types of unsupervised ensemble learning methods to investigate the performance of forecasting on clustered or simply aggregated load: bootstrap aggregating based and the newly proposed density-clustering based. Three new bootstrapping methods for time series analysis methods were newly proposed in order to handle the noisy behaviour of time series. The smart meter datasets used in our experiments come from Australia, London, and Ireland, where data from residential consumers were available. The achieved results suggest that for extremely fluctuating and noisy time series the forecasting accuracy improvement through the bagging can be a challenging task. However, our experimental evaluation shows that in most of the cases the density-based unsupervised ensemble learning methods are significantly improving forecasting accuracy of aggregated or clustered electricity load. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Bagging; Clustering; Ensemble learning; Forecasting; Unsupervised learning","Cluster analysis; Electric load forecasting; Electric power utilization; Forecasting; K-means clustering; Learning systems; Smart meters; Unsupervised learning; Bagging; Clustering; Electricity load forecasting; Electricity-consumption; Ensemble learning; Experimental evaluation; Pre-processing of data; Time series forecasting; Time series analysis",,,,,"Adhikari, R., Verma, G., Khandelwal, I., A model ranking based selective ensemble approach for time series forecasting (2015) Procedia Computer Science, 48, pp. 14-21; Ankerst, M., Breunig, M.M., Kriegel, H.P., Sander, J., Optics: Ordering points to identify the clustering structure (1999) In ACM Sigmod Record, 28, pp. 49-60. , ACM; Arthur, D., Vassilvitskii, S., K-means++: The advantages of careful seeding (2007) SODA ’07 Proceedings of the Eighteenth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, pp. 1027-1035; Bartholomew, D.J., Box, G.E.P., Jenkins, G.M., Time series analysis forecasting and control (1971) Operational Research Quarterly (1970–1977), 22 (2), p. 199; Bergmeir, C., Hyndman, R.J., Benítez, J.M., Bagging exponential smoothing methods using stl decomposition and box–cox transformation (2016) International Journal of Forecasting, 32 (2), pp. 303-312; Bilton, M., Carmichael, R., Schofield, J.R., Strbac, G., Tindemans, S., Woolf, M., (2016) Low carbon london project: Data from the dynamic time-of-use electricity pricing trial, 2013, , https://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-7857-2, [data collection].

It is therefore important to develop accurate methods for forecasting dengue and ILI incidences. Since data from multiple sources (such as dengue and ILI case counts, electronic health records and frequency of multiple internet search terms from Google Trends) can improve forecasts, standard time series analysis methods are inadequate to estimate all the parameter values from the limited amount of data available if we use multiple sources. In this paper, we use a computationally efficient implementation of the known variable selection method that we call the Autoregressive Likelihood Ratio (ARLR) method. This method combines sparse representation of time series data, electronic health records data (for ILI) and Google Trends data to forecast dengue and ILI incidences. This sparse representation method uses an algorithm that maximizes an appropriate likelihood ratio at every step. Using numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method recovers the underlying sparse model much more accurately than the lasso method. We apply our method to dengue case count data from five countries/states: Brazil, Mexico, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand and to ILI case count data from the United States. Numerical experiments show that our method outperforms existing time series forecasting methods in forecasting the dengue and ILI case counts. In particular, our method gives a 18 percent forecast error reduction over a leading method that also uses data from multiple sources. It also performs better than other methods in predicting the peak value of the case count and the peak time. © 2019 Rangarajan et al.

The models were developed to forecast the hourly mean wind speeds, which are applied to the wind turbine's power curve to obtain wind power forecasts with horizons ranging from 1 to 24 h ahead, for three different locations of the Brazilian Northeast. The average improvement of Normalized Mean Absolute Error-NMAE for the first six, twelve, eighteen and twenty-four hourly power generation forecasts obtained by using the models proposed in this article were 70.87%, 71.99%, 67.77% and 58.52%, respectively. These results of improvements in relation to the Persistence Model-PM are among the best published results to date for wind power forecasting. The adopted methodology was adequate, assuring statistically reliable forecasts. When comparing the performance of fully-connected feedforward Artificial Neural Networks-ANN and ESN, it was observed that both are powerful time series forecasting tools, but the ESN proved to be more suited for wind power forecasting. © 2018 by the authors.","Echo state network; Neural networks; Reservoir computing; Wavelet transform; Wind forecasting","Feedforward neural networks; Multiresolution analysis; Neural networks; Time series analysis; Wavelet transforms; Wind effects; Wind power; Wind turbines; Echo state networks; Feed-forward artificial neural networks; Hourly mean wind speed; Power generation forecasts; Reservoir Computing; Short-term wind power forecasting; Time series forecasting; Wind forecasting; Weather forecasting",,,,,"De Aquino, R.R.B., Gouveia, H.T.V., Lira, M.M.S., Ferreira, A.A., Neto, O.N., Carvalho, M.A., (2012) Models Based on Neural Networks and Neuro-Fuzzy Systems for Wind Power Prediction Using Wavelet Transform As Data Preprocessing Method, pp. 272-281. , Communications in Computer and Information Science Series; Springer: Berlin/Heidelberg, Germany; Venayagamoorthy, G.K., Rohrig, K., Erlich, I., One step ahead: Short-term wind power forecasting and intelligent predictive control based on data analytics (2012) IEEE Power Energy Mag., 10, pp. 70-78. , [CrossRef]; Milligan, M., Kirby, B., Acker, T., Ahlstrom, M., Frew, B., Goggin, M., Lasher, W., Osborn, D., (2015) Review and Status of Wind Integration and Transmission in United States: Key Issues and Lessons Learned, , Technical Report; National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL): Golden, CO, USA; Liu, H., Tian, H., Pan, D., Li, Y., Forecasting models for wind speed using wavelet, wavelet packet, time series and artificial neural networks (2013) Appl.

We show how new object properties can change the statistics of the predictors, which makes them the candidates for modeling a wide range of time series systems.

More and more time series data are produced in various fields. It provides data for the research of time series analysis method, and promotes the development of time series research. Due to the generation of highly complex and large-scale time series data, the construction of forecasting models for time series data brings greater challenges. The main challenges of time series modeling are high complexity of time series data, low accuracy and poor generalization ability of prediction model. This paper attempts to cover the existing modeling methods for time series data and classify them. In addition, we make comparisons between different methods and list some potential directions for time series forecasting. © 2013 IEEE.","forecasting; modeling; Time series analysis","Forecasting; Harmonic analysis; Analysis method; Forecast method; Forecasting methods; Forecasting models; Hotspots; Large-scale time series; Modeling; Time-series analysis; Time-series data; Times series; Time series analysis",,,,,"Tong, H., Lim, K.S., Threshold autoregression, limit cycles and cyclical data (1980) J.

A still open gap in that literature is that statistical and ensemble learning approaches systematically present lower predictive performance than deep learning methods. They generally disregard the data sequence aspect entangled with multivariate data represented in more than one time series. Conversely, this work presents a novel neural network architecture for time-series forecasting that combines the power of graph evolution with deep recurrent learning on distinct data distributions; we named our method Recurrent Graph Evolution Neural Network (ReGENN). The idea is to infer multiple multivariate relationships between co-occurring time-series by assuming that the temporal data depends not only on inner variables and intra-temporal relationships (i.e., observations from itself) but also on outer variables and inter-temporal relationships (i.e., observations from other-selves). An extensive set of experiments was conducted comparing ReGENN with dozens of ensemble methods and classical statistical ones, showing sound improvement of up to 64.87% over the competing algorithms. Furthermore, we present an analysis of the intermediate weights arising from ReGENN, showing that by looking at inter and intra-temporal relationships simultaneously, time-series forecasting is majorly improved if paying attention to how multiple multivariate data synchronously evolve.

Conventionally, customer segmentation approaches are utilized when dealing with a large population of customers. Inspired by this idea, a new methodology is proposed in this study to perform segment-level customer behavior forecasting. To keep the dynamic nature of customer behavior, customer behavior is represented as a time series. Therefore, customer behavior forecasting is changed into a time series forecasting problem. The proposed methodology contains two main components i.e. clustering and forecasting. In the clustering phase, time series are clustered using time series clustering algorithms, and then, in the forecasting phase, the behavior of each segment is predicted via time series forecasting techniques. The main objective is to predict future behavior at segment level. The forecasting component also consists of a combined method exploiting the concept of forecast fusion. The combined method employs a pool of forecasters both from traditional time series forecasting and computational intelligence methods. To test the usefulness of the proposed method, a case study is carried out using the data of customers’ point of sale (POS) in a bank. The results of the experiments demonstrate that the combined method outperforms all other individual forecasters in terms of symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE). The proposed methodology can be correspondingly applied in other areas and applications of time series forecasting. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Customer behavior; Forecasting; RFM model; Time series analysis","Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Intelligent computing; Sales; Time series; Computational intelligence methods; Customer behavior; Customer segmentation; Forecasting tools; Mean absolute percentage error; Time series clustering; Time series forecasting; Time series techniques; Forecasting",,,,,"Abirami, M., Pattabiraman, V., Data mining approach for intelligent customer behavior analysis for a retail store (2016) Proceedings of the 3Rd International Symposium on Big Data and Cloud Computing Challenges (ISBCC-16’), 2016, pp. 283-291. , Vijayakumar V, Neelanarayanan V, Springer, Cham; Aghabozorgi, S., Seyed Shirkhorshidi, A., Ying Wah, T., Time-series clustering – A decade review (2015) Information Systems, 53, pp. 16-38. , 10.1016/j.is.2015.04.007 DOI; Akhondzadeh-Noughabi, E., Albadvi, A., Mining the dominant patterns of customer shifts between segments by using top-k and distinguishing sequential rules (2015) Manag Decis, 53, pp. 1976-2003; Anantasech, P., Ratanamahatana, C.A., Enhanced weighted dynamic time warping for time series classification (2019) Third International Congress on Information and Communication Technology, pp. 655-664. , Springer, New York; Andrawis, R.R., Atiya, A.F., El-Shishiny, H., Forecast combinations of computational intelligence and linear models for the NN5 time series forecasting competition (2011) Int J Forecast, 27, pp. 672-688; Ballestar, M.T., Grau-Carles, P., Sainz, J., Customer segmentation in e-commerce: applications to the cashback business model (2018) J Bus Res, 88, pp. 407-414. , DOI: 10.1016/j.jbusres.2017.11.047; Batista, G.E., Keogh, E.J., Tataw, O.M., De Souza, V.M., CID: an efficient complexity-invariant distance for time series (2014) Data Min Knowl Disc, 28, pp. 634-669; Böttcher, M., Spott, M., Nauck, D., Kruse, R., Mining changing customer segments in dynamic markets (2009) Expert Syst Appl, 36, pp. 155-164; Box, G.E., Jenkins, G.M., Reinsel, G.C., Ljung, G.M., (2015) Time series analysis: forecasting and control, , Wiley, New Jersey; Brockwell, P.J., Davis, R.A., Calder, M.V., (2002) Introduction to Time Series and Forecasting, , Springer New York; Čater, T., Čater, B., Product and relationship quality influence on customer commitment and loyalty in B2B manufacturing relationships (2010) Ind Mark Manag, 39, pp. 1321-1333; Cen, Z., Wang, J., Forecasting neural network model with novel CID learning rate and EEMD algorithms on energy market (2018) Neurocomputing, 317, pp. 168-178; Chan, C.C.H., Hwang, Y.-R., Wu, H.-C., Marketing segmentation using the particle swarm optimization algorithm: A case study (2016) J Ambient Intell Hum Comput, 7, pp. 855-863. , DOI: 10.1007/s12652-016-0389-9; Chen, Y., Hao, Y., A feature weighted support vector machine and K-nearest neighbor algorithm for stock market indices prediction (2017) Expert Syst Appl, 80, pp. 340-355. , DOI: 10.1016/j.eswa.2017.02.044; Cheng, D., Zhu, Q., Huang, J., Wu, Q., Yang, L., A novel cluster validity index based on local cores (2019) IEEE Trans Neural Netw Learn Syst, 30, pp. 985-999. , DOI: 10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2853710; Chiang, W.-Y., Applying data mining for online CRM marketing strategy: an empirical case of coffee shop industry in Taiwan (2018) Br Food J, 120, pp. 665-675; Chouakria, A.D., Nagabhushan, P.N., Adaptive dissimilarity index for measuring time series proximity (2007) Adv Data Anal Classif, 1, pp. 5-21; Crone, S.F., Hibon, M., Nikolopoulos, K., Advances in forecasting with neural networks?

Extensive research has been conducted using neural networks (NNs) to improve their forecasting accuracy. In general, the inputs to NNs are the auto-regressive (i.e. lagged variables) of one or more time series. In addition, either network outputs or network errors have been used as extra inputs to NNs. In this paper, however, we propose a novel recurrent neural network forecasting model which is called the ridge polynomial neural network with error-output feedbacks (RPNN-EOF). RPNN-EOF has two main types of inputs: auto-regressive and moving-average inputs. The former is represented by the lagged variables of a time series, while the latter is represented by feeding back network error to the input layer. In addition, network output is fed back to the input layer. The proposed recurrent model has the ability to produce more accurate forecasts due to the advantages of learning temporal dependence and the direct modelling of the moving-average component. A comparative analysis of RPNN-EOF with five neural network models was completed using ten time series. Simulation results have shown that RPNN-EOF is the most accurate model among all the compared models with the time series used. This shows that employing auto-regressive and moving-average inputs together helps to produce more accurate forecasts. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Error-output feedbacks;

There is a whole field of research focused on this area, called technology forecasting, in which bibliometrics plays an important role. Within that framework, this paper presents a forecasting approach focused on a specific field of technology forecasting: research activity related to an emerging technology. This approach is based on four research fields—bibliometrics, text mining, time series modelling and time series forecasting—and is structured in five interlinked steps that generate a continuous flow of information. The main milestone is the generation of time series that measure the level of research activity and can be used for forecasting. The usefulness of this approach is shown by applying it to an emerging technology: cloud computing. The results enable the technology to be structured into five main sub-technologies which are characterised through five time series. Time series analysis of the trends related to each sub-technology shows that Privacy and Security has been the most active sub-technology to date in this area and is expected to maintain its level of interest in the near future. © 2017, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Bibliometrics; Research-activity forecasting; Structural time series models; Technology forecasting; Text mining; Trend analysis",,,,,,"Anderson, B.D.O., Moore, J.B., (1979) Optimal filtering, , Prentice-Hall, Englewood, NJ; Bengisu, M., Nekhili, R., Forecasting emerging technologies with the aid of science and technology databases (2006) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 73 (7), pp. 835-844; Bildosola, I., Rio-Bélver, R., Cilleruelo, E., Forecasting the big services era: Novel approach combining statistical methods, expertise and technology roadmapping (2015) Enhancing synergies in a collaborative environment, pp. 371-379. , Cortés P, Maeso-González E, Escudero-Santana A, (eds), Springer, Berlin; Börner, K., Chen, C., Boyack, K.W., Visualizing knowledge domains (2003) Annual Review of Information Science and Technology, 37 (1), pp. 179-255; Bowman, K.O., Shenton, L.R., Omnibus contours for departures from normality based on √b 1 and b 2 (1975) Biometrika, 62, pp. 243-250; Brunk, G., Swarming of innovations, fractal patterns, and the historical time series of US patents (2003) Scientometrics, 56 (1), pp. 61-80; Chen, Y.H., Chen, C.Y., Lee, S.C., Technology forecasting and patent strategy of hydrogen energy and fuel cell technologies (2011) International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 36 (12), pp. 6957-6969; Global mobile data traffic forecast update (2015) 2014–2019 (white paper); Web mining: Information and pattern discovery on the world wide web (1997) In Proceedings of the ninth IEEE international conference on tools with artificial intelligence, , Cooley, R., Mobasher, B., & Srivastava, J.

However, the feasibility of applying intelligent algorithms to build the Ensemble Model presents a challenge of its own. In this work, an Extreme Learning Machine ensemble is applied to the Time Series modelling problem. We develop a thorough study of the models that will be candidates to compose the ensemble, obtaining statistical results of optimal topologies to solve each Time Series problem. The proposed method for the ensemble is the weighted averaging method, where the parameters (weights) are tuned with the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. Lastly, the ensemble is tested first in the well known Santa Fe Time Series Competition benchmark. Given the obtained satisfactory results, the ensemble is secondly tested in a real problem of Spain's electric consumption forecasting. It is demonstrated that the PSO is a suitable algorithm to optimize Extreme Learning Machine ensemble and that the proposed strategy can obtain good results in both Time Series problems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Electric Consumption Forecasting; ELM; Ensemble; PSO; Time-Series","Electric machine theory; Electric power utilization; Knowledge acquisition; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Time series; Electric consumption; Extreme learning machine; Intelligent Algorithms; Optimal topologies; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Time series forecasting; Time-series modelling; Weighted averaging; Machine learning; Article; electric consumption forecasting; electricity; extreme learning machine; forecasting; machine learning; mathematical computing; mathematical model; measurement accuracy; methodology; particle swarm optimization; process optimization; seasonal variation; time series analysis",,,,,"Wang, H., Hu, C., Chen, Y., Zhou, B., Chen, Z., Time-series based ensemble forecasting algorithm for out-limit detection on stable section of power network (2020) The 8th International Conference on Computer Engineering and Networks (CENet2018), pp. 904-916. , Q.

Remarkably, ESNs still enjoy the universal approximation property despite the training procedure being entirely linear. In this paper, we prove that an ESN trained on a sequence of observations from an ergodic dynamical system (with invariant measure μ) using Tikhonov least squares regression against a set of targets, will approximate the target function in the L2(μ) norm. In the special case that the targets are future observations, the ESN is learning the next step map, which allows time series forecasting. We demonstrate the theory numerically by training an ESN using Tikhonov least squares on a sequence of scalar observations of the Lorenz system. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Delay embedding; Liquid state machine; Lorenz equations; Recurrent neural networks; Reservoir computing; Time series analysis","Computation theory; Dynamical systems; Least squares approximations; Multilayer neural networks; Network layers; Time series analysis; Delay-embedding; Echo state networks; Ergodics; Least Square; Liquid state machines; Lorenz equation; Reservoir Computing; Single layer; Tikhonov; Time-series analysis; Recurrent neural networks",,,,,"Jaeger, H., The “echo state” approach to analysing and training recurrent neural networks (2001); Maass, W., Natschläger, T., Markram, H., Real-time computing without stable states: A new framework for neural computation based on perturbations (2002) Neural Comput., 14, pp. 2531-2560; Skowronski, M.D., Harris, J.G., Automatic speech recognition using a predictive echo state network classifier (2007) Neural Netw., 20, pp. 414-423. , echo State Networks and Liquid State Machines; Tong, M.H., Bickett, A.D., Christiansen, E.M., Cottrell, G.W., Learning grammatical structure with echo state networks (2007) Neural Netw., 20, pp. 424-432. , echo State Networks and Liquid State Machines; Ilies, I., Jaeger, H., Kosuchinas, O., Rincon, M., Sakenas, V., Vaskevicius, N., Stepping forward through echoes of the past: forecasting with echo state networks (2007); Lin, X., Yang, Z., Song, Y., Short-term stock price prediction based on echo state networks (2009) Expert Syst.

This deadly virus is infecting people rapidly and has targeted 4.93 million people across the world, with 227 K people being infected only in Italy. Cases of nCOV are quickly increasing whereas the number of nCOV test kits available in hospitals are limited. Under these conditions, an automated system for the classification of patients into nCOV positive and negative cases, is a much needed tool against the pandemic, helping in a selective use of the limited number of test kits. In this research, Convolutional Neural Network-based models (one block VGG, two block VGG, three block VGG, four block VGG, LetNet-5, AlexNet, and Resnet-50) have been employed for the detection of Corona-virus and SARS_MERS infected patients, distinguishing them from the healthy subjects, using lung X-ray scans, which has proven to be a challenging task, due to overlapping characteristics of different corona virus types. Furthermore, LSTM model has been used for time series forecasting of nCOV cases, in the following 10 days, in Italy. The evaluation results obtained, proved that the VGG1 model distinguishes the three classes at an accuracy of almost 91%, as compared to other models, whereas the approach based on the LSTM predicts the number of nCOV cases with 99% accuracy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Convolutional Neural Networks; LSTM; NCOV; VGG-16","Automation; Computer viruses; Convolutional neural networks; Long short-term memory; Time series; Viruses; Automated systems; Evaluation results; Healthy subjects; Infected patients; Learning approach; Test kits; Time series forecasting; Time series prediction; Deep learning; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; child; convolutional neural network; coronavirus disease 2019; deep learning; evaluation study; female; human; Italy; male; measurement accuracy; Middle East respiratory syndrome; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; nonhuman; pandemic; predictive value; priority journal; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; thorax radiography; time series analysis; very elderly; virus identification; Betacoronavirus; classification; mortality; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Deep Learning; Humans; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS-CoV-2",,,,,"Ai, T., Yang, Z., Hou, H., Correlation of chest ct and rt-pcr testing in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China: a report of 1014 cases (2020) Radiology; Basu, S., Mitra, S., Deep Learning for Screening Covid-19 Using Chest X-ray Images (2020), (arXiv preprint); Beck, B.R., Shin, B., Choi, Y., Park, S., Kang, K., Predicting commercially available antiviral drugs that may act on the novel coronavirus (sars-cov-2) through a drug-target interaction deep learning model (2020) Comput.

Fluctuations in Tsoc alter gas absorption and emission capacity of the soil, which mutually influence climate changes. Hence, providing viable methodologies of modeling Tsoc is of great importance. Since thorough investigations of time series structure are mostly neglected, and appropriate pre-processing methods are not applied to them, the direct use of nonlinear methods for soil temperature forecasting has become more common than other approaches. In this study, unlike most of the existing studies that estimate Tsoc as a variables based approach, soil temperature is forecasted using a linear stochastic based methodology with sufficient knowledge of time series structure. With this methodology, the components of the Tsoc time series are determined in order to perform stochastic modeling using Holt-Winters advanced exponential smoothing. The results of this procedure are compared with two stochastic techniques based on seasonal standardization (stdω) and spectral analysis (sf) in terms of six Tsoc time series at each station. The Tsoc. time series applied in the current study were measured at Bandar Abbas and Kerman synoptic stations, Iran, at depths of 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, and 100 cm. Owing to the comparison of the applied techniques in different Tsoc time series analysis, the stochastic model with Holt-Winters advanced exponential smoothing (Bandar Abbas station: (R2% = 96.649, RMSE = 0.977, MAPE% = 1.963, AICc = −733.006; Kerman station: R2% = 92.416, RMSE = 1.806, MAPE% = 7.793, AICc = 360.410) outperformed the stdω and sf methods. In addition to comparing linear stochastic methods, the results of Tsoc modeling are compared with two powerful nonlinear methods. In an antecedent study on the mentioned sites, Nahvi et al. (2016) employed extreme learning machine (ELM) and self-adaptive evolutionary ELM (SaE-ELM) nonlinear techniques. A comparison of results indicates that the proposed methodology outperformed the nonlinear models (ELM and SaE-ELM). Indeed, the proposed linear based stochastic model not only enhanced forecasting accuracy but also demonstrated the capability of linear models in Tsoc time series forecasting. Concerning the comprehensibility and generality of the framework, it can apply to other stations with different climatological conditions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Holt-winters; Preprocessing; Soil; Stochastic; Sustainable development; Water Resource Management","Agriculture; Climate change; Forecasting; Gas absorption; Learning systems; Soils; Spectrum analysis; Stochastic systems; Temperature; Time series analysis; Absorption and emissions; Climatological conditions; Exponential smoothing; Extreme learning machine; Pre-processing method; Stochastic techniques; Sustainable agriculture; Time series forecasting; Stochastic models; absorption; agricultural soil; agricultural technology; alternative agriculture; machine learning; prediction; smoothing; soil temperature; spectral analysis; standardization; stochasticity; weather station; Bandar Abbas; Hormozgan; Iran; Ulmus",,,,,"Arkhangel'skaya, T.A., Umarova, A.B., (2008), pp. 276-285. , Thermal diffusivity and temperature regime of soils in large lysimeters of the experimental soil station of Moscow State University.

Deep learning such as LSTM and auto-encoder can learn representations automatically and has attracted considerable attention in time series forecasting. However, current approaches mainly focus on point estimation, which leads to the inability to quantify uncertainty. Meantime, existing deep uncertainty quantification methods suffer from various limitations in practice. To this end, this paper presents a novel end-to-end framework called deep prediction interval and point estimation (DeepPIPE) that simultaneously performs multi-step point estimation and uncertainty quantification for time series forecasting. The merits of this approach are threefold: first, it requires no prior assumption on the distribution of data noise; second, it utilizes a novel hybrid loss function that improves the accuracy and stability of forecasting; third, it is only optimized by back-propagation algorithm, which is time friendly and easy to be implemented. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on three real-world datasets. © 2020","Deep learning; Forecasting; Time series; Uncertainty quantification","Backpropagation; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Time series; Uncertainty analysis; Deep uncertainties; Distribution-free; Point estimation; Prediction interval; Real-world datasets; State-of-the-art performance; Time series forecasting; Uncertainty quantifications; Deep learning; article; back propagation; deep learning; forecasting; loss of function mutation; noise; prediction; time series analysis; uncertainty",,,,,"Choudhary, S., Hiranandani, G., Saini, S.K., Sparse decomposition for time series forecasting and anomaly detection (2018) SIAM International Conference on Data Mining, pp. 522-530; Wang, J., Gu, Q., Wu, J., Liu, G., Xiong, Z., Traffic speed prediction and congestion source exploration: a deep learning method (2016) International Conference on Data Mining, pp. 499-508; Yu, R., Li, Y., Shahabi, C., Demiryurek, U., Liu, Y., Deep learning: a generic approach for extreme condition traffic forecasting (2017) SIAM International Conference on Data Mining, pp. 777-785; Zhang, J., Zheng, Y., Qi, D., Li, R., Yi, X., Li, T., Predicting citywide crowd flows using deep spatio-temporal residual networks (2018) Artif.

This temporal dependency (i.e. number of past samples required for a good prediction) is generally addressed by feeding a number of past instances to the model in an empirical manner. Conventional approaches mostly rely on offline model, making them impractical to be adopted in the online or streaming context. Hence, a novel method of online temporality analysis is proposed in this paper. The estimated temporality is then employed to form an Adaptive Temporal Neural Network (ATNN) with an elastic memory capable of automatically selecting number of past samples to be used. Temporality change or drift can be a common occurrence in data streams. Hence a drift detection mechanism is also proposed. Once such drift is detected, a drift handling mechanism kicks in which utilizes the rate of drift, making our solution truly autonomous. The entire mechanism is termed as LEMON: Learning Elastic Memory Online. LEMON although not a time series model in itself, can work with any predictive models to improve their performance. Synthetic datasets are used here as proof of correct temporality estimation and drift detection whereas real world datasets are employed to demonstrate how LEMON improves the predictive performance and speed of an existing model with the knowledge of temporality and drift. © 2019","Adaptive temporal network; Drift detection; Elastic memory; Online learning; Past dependency in time series forecasting; Temporal neural network; Temporality determination; Time series forecasting","Citrus fruits; Forecasting; Time series; Elastic memory; Online learning; Temporal networks; Temporal neural networks; Temporality determination; Time series forecasting; E-learning; article; forecasting; learning; lemon; memory; nonhuman; time series analysis; velocity",,,,,"Haldrup, N., Nielsen, F.S., Nielsen, M.Ø., A vector autoregressive model for electricity prices subject to long memory and regime switching (2010) Energy Econ., 32 (5), pp. 1044-1058; Colak, I., Sagiroglu, S., Yesilbudak, M., Data mining and wind power prediction: a literature review (2012) Renew.

Thus, a fuzzy identification strategy is proposed, which considers the following (among other parameters): the extended autocorrelation function and the number of triangular fuzzy sets. Using a non-iterative procedure based on a fuzzy version of the extended autocorrelation function, the interpolation and generalization capabilities of fuzzy systems were exploited in order to obtain a robust forecast, even when considering a time series with insufficient data. In order to increase the accuracy of the forecasting algorithm, several parameters were tested and optimized using computational simulations. Several parameters inherent to the forecasting algorithm proposed in this study were tested and optimized. To evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology, two case studies were performed on two databases that are available in the literature. The proposed fuzzy forecasting algorithm yielded very good results, given the low forecasting errors that were returned by the identified models, especially when compared with the conventional statistical methodologies and other fuzzy forecasting methods that are established in the literature. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Fuzzy forecasting; Fuzzy identification method; Fuzzy sets; Fuzzy time series","Autocorrelation; Computation theory; Forecasting; Fuzzy sets; Iterative methods; Parameter estimation; Time series; Time series analysis; Autocorrelation functions; Computational simulation; Fuzzy forecasting; Fuzzy identification method; Fuzzy time series; Generalization capability; Statistical methodologies; Time series forecasting models; Fuzzy set theory",,,,,"Kantz, H., Schreiber, T., Nonlinear Time Series Analysis (2004), Cambridge University Press; Song, Q., Chissom, B.S., Fuzzy Time series and its models (1993) Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 54 (3), pp. 269-277; Song, Q., Chissom, B.S., Forecasting enrollments with fuzzy time series part i (1993) Fuzzy Sets Syst., 54 (1), pp. 1-9; Song, Q., Chissom, B.S., Forecasting enrollments with fuzzy time series part c (1994) Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 62, pp. 1-8; Egrioglu, E., PSO-Based high order time invariant fuzzy time series method: Application to stock exchange data (2014) Econ.

The objective of this study was to propose a hybrid neural network model based on wavelet transform (WT) and feature extraction for time series forecasting. The motivation of the proposed model, which is called PCA-WCCNN, is to establish a single simplified model with shorter training time and satisfactory forecasting performance. This model combines the principal component analysis (PCA) and WT with artificial neural networks (ANNs). Given a forecasting sequence, order of the original forecasting model is determined firstly. Secondly, the original time series is decomposed into approximation and detail components by employing WT technique. Then, instead of using all the components as inputs, feature inputs are extracted from all the sub-series obtained from the above step. Finally, based on the extracted features and all the sub-series, a famous neural network construction method called cascade-correlation algorithm is applied to train neural network model to learn the dynamics. As an illustration, the proposed model is compared with two classical models and two hybrid models, respectively. They are the traditional cascade-correlation neural network, back-propagation neural network, wavelet-based cascade-correlation network using all the wavelet components as inputs to establish one model (WCCNN) and wavelet-based cascade-correlation network with combination of each sub-series model (WCCNN multi-models). Results obtained from this study indicate that the proposed method improves the accuracy of ANN and can yield better efficiency than other four neural network models. © 2016, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.","Cascade-correlation algorithm;

Due to the semi-artisan production of the wheel, it is not possible to know in advance the performance of the wheel. One of the most useful parameters to characterize the grinding process is the specific grinding energy, which varies with the wear of the grinding wheel during its lifecycle. Thus, it would be useful to model the specific grinding energy in order to get information about the performance of the wheel before buying it. Unlike the typical applications of time series forecasting, in this work, a totally different issue is presented: the prediction of new and complete time series bounded in time without initial or historic values. In this context, an analysis of the effect of the time characteristics and the number of points of the time series on the prediction capabilities of the ANN is presented. The results of the analysis show that 200 points are enough to predict a complete time series up to 2000 mm3/mm of specific volume of material removed. Actually, it is shown that modelling the evolution of the grinding specific energy up to 2000 mm3/mm is possible. The net shows good capability to generalize to new grinding conditions, with errors below 23.65 %, and to new wheel characteristics, with errors below 20.01 %, which are satisfactory from the grinding process perspective. © 2015, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.","Complete time series; Dynamic modelling; Generalization; Recurrent neural networks; Specific grinding energy; Static inputs","Dynamic models; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Recurrent neural networks; Time series; Time series analysis; Wheels; Generalization; Grinding conditions; Prediction capability; Specific grinding energy; Static inputs; Time characteristics; Time series forecasting; Typical application; Grinding (machining)",,,,,"Coit, D.W., Smith, A.E., Using designed experiments to produce robust neural network models of manufacturing processes.

This is a challenging task as the problems are always accompanied by multi-modality streams and lead-lag effects. For example, the price movements of stock are reflections of complicated market states in different diffusion speeds, including historical price series, media news, associated events, etc. Furthermore, the financial industry requires forecasting models to be interpretable and compliant. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a multi-modality graph neural network (MAGNN) to learn from these multimodal inputs for financial time series prediction. The heterogeneous graph network is constructed by the sources as nodes and relations in our financial knowledge graph as edges. To ensure the model interpretability, we leverage a two-phase attention mechanism for joint optimization, allowing end-users to investigate the importance of inner-modality and inter-modality sources. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of MAGNN in financial market prediction. Our method provides investors with a profitable as well as interpretable option and enables them to make informed investment decisions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Deep learning; Graph attention; Graph neural network; Quantitative investment","Commerce; Deep neural networks; Forecasting; Knowledge management; Risk assessment; Time series analysis; Deep learning; Financial time series; Financial time series forecasting; Graph attention; Graph neural networks; Investment decisions; Market risks; Multi-modality; Quantitative investment; Time-series analysis; Investments",,,,,"(2020), https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD, Worldbank, Market capitalization of listed domestic companies Accessed 16-March-2021; Fama, E.F., The behavior of stock-market prices (1965) J.

To that aim, a database containing road collisions, fatalities, and slight injuries data from Greece were derived from the Hellenic Statistical Authority (HSA) and covered a ten-year timeframe (from January 2010 to August 2020. The chosen time period contained normal operations, as well as the period of the first COVID-19-induced lockdown period in Greece. Three different Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) time series models were implemented in order to compare the observed measurements to forecasted values that were intended to depict assumed conditions; namely, without the appearance of the COVID-19 pandemic. Modelling results revealed that the total number of road collisions, fatalities, and slightly injured were decreased, mainly due to the sharp traffic volume decrease. However, the percentage reduction of the collision variables and traffic volume were found to be disproportionate, which probably indicates that more collisions occurred with regard to the prevailing traffic volume. An additional finding is that fatalities and slightly injured rates were significantly increased during the lockdown period and the subsequent month. Overall, it can be concluded that a worse performance was identified in terms of road safety. Since subsequent waves of COVID-19 cases and other pandemics may reappear in the future, the outcomes of the current study may be exploited for the improvement of road safety from local authorities and policymakers. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Fatalities; Injuries; Road collisions; Road Safety; Time Series",,,,,,"Abdul, K., Review of Global Menace of Road Accidents With Special Reference To Malaysia- a Social Perspective (2003) Malaysian J.

The novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, is spreading rapidly all over the world. The countries with dense populations, in particular, such as India, await imminent risk in tackling the epidemic. Different forecasting models are being used to predict future cases of COVID-19. The predicament for most of them is that they are not able to capture both the linear and nonlinear features of the data solely. Methods: We propose an ensemble model integrating an autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) and a nonlinear autoregressive neural network (NAR). ARIMA models are used to extract the linear correlations and the NAR neural network for modeling the residuals of ARIMA containing nonlinear components of the data. Comparison: Single ARIMA model, ARIMA-NAR model and few other existing models which have been applied on the COVID-19 data in different countries are compared based on performance evaluation parameters. Result: The hybrid combination displayed significant reduction in RMSE (16.23%), MAE (37.89%) and MAPE (39.53%) values when compared with single ARIMA model for daily observed cases. Similar results with reduced error percentages were found for daily reported deaths and cases of recovery as well. RMSE value of our hybrid model was lesser in comparison to other models used for forecasting COVID-19 in different countries. Conclusion: Results suggested the effectiveness of the new hybrid model over a single ARIMA model in capturing the linear as well as nonlinear patterns of the COVID-19 data. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","ARIMA; COVID-19; Forecasting; Hybrid model; NAR","Forecasting; Neural networks; Time series analysis; Autoregressive integrated moving average models; Autoregressive neural networks; Evaluation parameters; Forecasting models; Linear correlation; Nonlinear components; Nonlinear features; Time series forecasting; Autoregressive moving average model; Article; artificial neural network; coronavirus disease 2019; death; forecasting; human; India; pandemic; statistical model; COVID-19; Humans; India; Models, Statistical; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2",,,,,"https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series, 2019; https://www.who.int/ith/diseases/sars/en/, World Health Organization. 2004.

Such participation relies on the prediction of available capacity to support the reliable delivery of agreed reserves at a future time. In this work real historical trip data from a fleet of vehicles belonging to the University of Nottingham was used and a simulation developed to show how battery state-of-charge and available capacity would vary if these trips were taken in electric vehicles that were charged at simulated charging station locations. A time series forecasting neural network was developed to predict aggregated available capacity for the next 24-h period given input data from the previous 24 h and its increased predictive capability over a regression model trained using automated machine learning was demonstrated. The simulations were then extended to include delivery of reserves to satisfy the needs of simulated market events and the ability of the model to successfully adapt its predictions to such events was demonstrated. The authors conclude that this ability is of critical importance to the viability and success of future V2G services by supporting trading and vehicle utilisation decisions for multiple market events. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","CNN-LSTM network; Deep learning; Machine learning; Neural networks; V2G; Vehicle-to-grid","Automotive batteries; Charging (batteries); Commerce; Deep neural networks; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Fleet operations; Forecasting; Regression analysis; Vehicle-to-grid; Automated machines; Battery state of charge; Charging station locations; Electric vehicle batteries; Predictive capabilities; Time series forecasting; University of Nottingham; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Recurrent neural networks; artificial neural network; electric vehicle; energy planning; machine learning; power plant; prediction; time series analysis; university sector; England; Nottingham [England]; United Kingdom",,,,,"Kempton, W., Tomić, J., Vehicle-to-grid power implementation: from stabilizing the grid to supporting large-scale renewable energy (2005) J Power Sources, 144, pp. 280-294; Waldron, J., Rodrigues, L., Gillott, M., Naylor, S., Shipman, R., Towards an electric revolution: a review on vehicle- to-grid, smart charging and user behaviour (2019) Proc. 18th Int.

In this context, state-of-the-art internet-of-things (IoT)-based sensing platforms are often employed to generate, pre-process and assimilate real-time data from heterogeneous sensors and streaming data sources. Simultaneously, Time-Series Forecasting Algorithms (TSFAs) are responsible for generating reliable forecasts with a pre-defined forecast horizon and confidence. These TSFAs often rely on modelling the correlation between endogenous variables, the impact of exogenous variables on latent form and structural properties of data such as autocorrelation, periodicity, trend, pattern, and causality to approximate the model parameters. Traditionally, TSFAs such as the Holt–Winters (HW) and Autoregressive family of models (ARIMA) apply a linear and parametric approach towards model approximation, whilst models like Support Vector Regression (SVRs) and Neural Networks (NNs) adhere to a non-linear, non-parametric approach for modelling the historical data. Recently, Deep-Learning-based TSFAs such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTMS) have gained popularity due to their capability to model long sequences of highly non-linear and stochastic data effectively. However, the evolution of TSFAs for predicting agrometeorological parameters pivots around one-step-ahead forecasting, which often overestimates the performance metrics defined for validating forecast capabilities of potential TSFAs. Hence, this paper attempts to evaluate and compare the performance of different machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) based TSFAs under one-step and multi-step-ahead forecast scenarios, thereby estimating the generalization capabilities of TSFA models over unseen data. The data used in this study are collected from an Automatic Weather Station (AWS), sampled at an interval of 15 min, and range over one month. Temperature (T) and Humidity (H) observations from the AWS are further converted into univariate, supervised time-series diurnal data profiles. Finally, walk-forward validation is used to evaluate recursive one-step-ahead forecasts until the desired prediction horizon is achieved. The results show that the Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) and SVR models outperform their DL-based counterparts in one-step and multi-step ahead settings with a fixed forecast horizon. This work aims to present a baseline comparison between different TSFAs to assist the process of model selection and facilitate rapid ahead-of-time forecasting for end-user applications. © 2021 by the authors.

This article proposes a new variant of SNP systems, called gated spiking neural P (GSNP) systems, which are composed of gated neurons. Two gated mechanisms are introduced in the nonlinear spiking mechanism of GSNP systems, consisting of a reset gate and a consumption gate. The two gates are used to control the updating of states in neurons. Based on gated neurons, a prediction model for time series is developed, known as the GSNP model. Several benchmark univariate and multivariate time series are used to evaluate the proposed GSNP model and to compare several state-of-the-art prediction models. The comparison results demonstrate the availability and effectiveness of GSNP for time series forecasting.

Although different drivers show various driving characteristics, the kinematic parameters of human‐driven vehicles can be used as a predictor for predicting the driver’s intention within a short time. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid approach for vehicle behavior recognition at intersections based on time series prediction and deep learning networks. First, the lateral position, longitudinal position, speed, and acceleration of the vehicle are predicted using the online autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) algorithm. Next, a variant of the long short‐term memory network, called the bidirectional long short‐term memory (Bi‐LSTM) network, is used to detect the vehicle’s turning behavior using the predicted parameters, as well as the derived parameters, i.e., the lateral velocity, lateral acceleration, and heading angle. The validity of the proposed method is verified at real intersections using the public driving data of the next generation simulation (NGSIM) project. The results of the turning behavior detection show that the proposed hybrid approach exhibits significant improvement over a conventional algorithm; the average recognition rates are 94.2% and 93.5% at 2 s and 1 s, respectively, before initiating the turning maneuver. © MDPI AG.

The high-dimensionality, velocity and variety of the data collected in many of these applications pose significant and unique challenges that must be carefully addressed for each of them. In this work, a novel Temporal Logistic Neural Bag-of-Features approach, that can be used to tackle these challenges, is proposed. The proposed method can be effectively combined with deep neural networks, leading to powerful deep learning models for time series analysis. However, combining existing BoF formulations with deep feature extractors pose significant challenges: the distribution of the input features is not stationary, tuning the hyper-parameters of the model can be especially difficult and the normalizations involved in the BoF model can cause significant instabilities during the training process. The proposed method is capable of overcoming these limitations by a employing a novel adaptive scaling mechanism and replacing the classical Gaussian-based density estimation involved in the regular BoF model with a logistic kernel. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using extensive experiments on a large-scale limit order book dataset that consists of more than 4 million limit orders. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bag-of-Features; Limit order book data; Time-series forecasting","Correlation theory; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Financial data processing; Forecasting; Large dataset; Adaptive scaling; Density estimation; Feature extractor; Financial time series forecasting; High dimensionality; Load predictions; Time series forecasting; Training process; Time series analysis",,,,,"Akita, R., Yoshihara, A., Matsubara, T., Uehara, K., Deep learning for stock prediction using numerical and textual information (2016) Proceedings of the IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Computer and Information Science, pp. 1-6; Bailly, A., Malinowski, S., Tavenard, R., Guyet, T., Chapel, L., Bag-of-temporal-sift-words for time series classification (2015) ECML/PKDD Workshop on Advanced Analytics and Learning on Temporal Data; Baydogan, M.G., Runger, G., Tuv, E., A Bag-of-Features framework to classify time series (2013) IEEE Trans.

A large window length has a potential to produce a good model fit, but it is unlikely to produce a parsimonious forecasting model. In this paper, we propose a new parsimonious vector forecasting model which uses an optimal m ((Formula presented.)) coefficients for forecasting, instead of the L–1 coefficients used in the standard vector forecasting method. This model enables SSA users to consider two different values for the window length: one for reconstruction and another for forecasting. The proposed and standard methods are compared methodologically and also implemented and tested on daily observations of six stocks: AAPL, AMZN, EBAY, IBM, INTC, MSFT, between Jan 1 2000 and Dec 31 2015, each including 4025 observations.

Objective: This survey paper presents a review of recent advances in the area of Machine Learning techniques and artificial intelligence used for forecasting different events. Methods: This paper presents an extensive survey of work done in the field of Machine Learning where hybrid models for are compared to the basic models for forecasting on the basis of error parameters like Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD), Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRM-SE). Results: Table 1 summarizes important papers discussed in this paper on the basis of some parameters which explain the efficiency of hybrid models or when the model is used in isolation. Conclusion: The hybrid model has realized accurate results as compared when the models were used in isolation yet some research papers argue that hybrids cannot always outperform individual models. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.","ANN; ARIMA; Hybrids; MAPE; MSE; Time series forecasting","Autoregressive moving average model; Errors; Forecasting; Machine learning; Mean square error; Surveys; Time series; Time series analysis; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Machine learning techniques; Mean absolute deviations; Mean absolute error; Mean absolute percentage error; Root mean square errors; Time series forecasting; Time series models; Neural networks",,,,,"Madan, R., Sarathimangipudi, P., Predicting computer network traffic: A time series forecasting approach using dwt, arima and rnn (2018) 2018 11th International Conference on Contemporary Com-puting, IC3 2018, pp. 2-4. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IC3.2018.8530608; Shui-Ling, Y.U., Stock price prediction based on ARIMA-RNN combined model"" (2017) 4th International Conference on Social Science (ICSS), , 978-1-60595-525-4; Khashei, M., Bijari, M., A novel hybridization of artificial neural networks and ARIMA models for time series forecasting (2011) Appl.

Because of the complexity and nonlinearity of the time series of container throughputs at ports, the methodology decomposes the original time series into several components, which are rather simpler sub-sequences. Consequently, difficult forecasting tasks are simplified into a number of relatively easier subtasks. In this way, the proposed hybrid models can improve the accuracy of forecasting significantly. In the methodology, four main steps are involved: data decomposition, component reconstruction based on the DCA, individual prediction for each reconstructed component, and ensemble prediction as the final output. An empirical analysis was conducted for illustration and verification purposes by using time series of container throughputs at three main ports in Bohai Rim, China. The results suggest that the proposed hybrid models are able to forecast better than do other benchmark models. Forecasting may facilitate effective real-time decision making for strategic management and policy drafting. Predictions of container throughput can help port managers make tactical and operational decisions, such as operations planning in ports, the scheduling of port equipment, and route optimization. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Container throughput; data characteristic analysis; decomposition-ensemble methodology; time series forecasting; wavelet transform","complexity; containerization; decomposition analysis; ensemble forecasting; forecasting method; nonlinearity; port operation; time series analysis; transform; China",,,,,"Bandt, C., Pompe, B., Permutation Entropy: A Natural Complexity Measure for Time Series (2002) Physical Review Letters, 88 (17), p. 174102; Bessec, M., Fouquau, J., Short-Run Electricity Load Forecasting with Combinations of Stationary Wavelet Transforms (2018) European Journal of Operational Research, 264, pp. 149-164; Box, G.E.P., Jenkins, G.M., (1976) Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control.

Investigating the properties and behaviors of CRP time series has recently emerged as an area of significant interest in informing clinical decision making. The area of cancer immunotherapy is a key application where CRP forecasting is critically needed. Therefore, predicting the future values of a CRP time series can provide useful information for clinical purposes. In this paper, we focus on CRP time series forecasting, comparing autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) modeling with deep learning. The CRP data are obtained from 24 patients with melanoma. This paper using CRP data indicates that deep learning provides significantly reduced prediction error compared to ARIMA modeling. © 2013 IEEE.","ARIMA; autoregressive modeling; Biomedical engineering; C-reactive protein; cancer; CRP; deep learning; forecasting; immunotherapy; machine learning; recurrent neural networks; time series analysis","Biomedical engineering; Decision making; Diagnosis; Diseases; Forecasting; Learning systems; Proteins; Recurrent neural networks; Time series analysis; ARIMA; Auto regressive models; C-reactive proteins; cancer; immunotherapy; Deep learning",,,,,"Pepys, M.B., The acute phase response and C-reactive protein (1995) Oxford Textbook of Medicine, pp. 1527-1533. , D.

The difficulties of forecasting oil prices stem from the nonlinearity and non-stationarity of their dynamics. However, the oil prices are closely correlated with global financial markets and economic conditions, which provides us with sufficient information to predict them. Traditional models are linear and parametric, and are not very effective in predicting oil prices. To address these problems, this study developed a new strategy. Deep (or hierarchical) multiple kernel learning (DMKL) was used to predict the oil price time series. Traditional methods from statistics and machine learning usually involve shallow models; however, they are unable to fully represent complex, compositional, and hierarchical data features. This explains why traditional methods fail to track oil price dynamics. This study aimed to solve this problem by combining deep learning and multiple kernel machines using information from oil, gold, and currency markets. DMKL is good at exploiting multiple information sources. It can effectively identify the relevant information and simultaneously select an apposite data representation. The kernels of DMKL were embedded in a directed acyclic graph (DAG), which is a deep model and efficient at representing complex and compositional data features. This provided a solid foundation for extracting the key features of oil price dynamics. By using real data for empirical testing, our new system robustly outperformed traditional models and significantly reduced the forecasting errors. © 2018 by the authors.

Fair understanding and estimation of how demand will vary facilitates the optimal utilization of resources. In a medical laboratory, accurate forecasting of future demand, that is, test volumes, can increase efficiency and facilitate long-term laboratory planning. Importantly, in an era of utilization management initiatives, accurately predicted volumes compared to the realized test volumes can form a precise way to evaluate utilization management initiatives. Laboratory test volumes are often highly amenable to forecasting by time-series models; however, the statistical software needed to do this is generally either expensive or highly technical. Method: In this paper, we describe an open-source web-based software tool for time-series forecasting and explain how to use it as a demand forecasting tool in clinical laboratories to estimate test volumes. Results: This tool has three different models, that is, Holt-Winters multiplicative, Holt-Winters additive, and simple linear regression. Moreover, these models are ranked and the best one is highlighted.

ARIMA is one of the general time series models and capable of representing time series which, although not necessary stationary, is homogeneous and in statistical equilibrium. This paper presents the characterization, main methods and problems of the time series by the detailed specific algorithm of software Eviews on analyzing the ARIMA model modeling methods, as well as its specific steps on drafting particular flow chart. Finally, it deals with the Producer Price Index (PPI) collected from the year 1978 to 2013 in China. The statistics related to first 33 years are used to train the models and the 3 past years are used to forecast. This paper constructs two models as ARIMA (1, 1, 1) and AR (1) by using the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation function of time series, and by comparing with the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the results of the model test, the ARIMA (1, 1, 1) is chosen as the best model for forecasting. The future value of PPI in the 3 past years shows that ARIMA (1, 1, 1) model has a minor error. It is concluded that a properly performed analysis of time series can be a useful tool for analysis and short-term prediction. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.","Algorithm; ARIMA model; Eviews; Experiment; Flow chart; Forecasting; Time series","Algorithms; Autocorrelation; Data mining; Decision making; Decision theory; Experiments; Flowcharting; Forecasting; Graphic methods; Time series; Akaike information criterion; ARIMA modeling; Eviews; Partial autocorrelation function; Producer price indices; Short term prediction; Statistical equilibrium; Time series forecasting models; Time series analysis",,,,,"Pandit, S.M., Wu, S.M., (1983) Time Series and System Analysis with Applications, , Wiley: New York; Liu, Z.Z., Pan, W., Study on air pollution index forecasting in xiamen city (2008) Mind Computat, 2, pp. 33-41; Narayanan, P., Basistha, A., Sarkar, S., Sachdeva, K., Trend analysis and ARIMA modeling of pre-monsoon rainfall data for western India (2013) Comptes.

This work attempts to investigate the abilities of various existing techniques when applied for short term, high granular time series forecasting of PM2.5. More specifically, a comparative study has been provided, taking into account both popularly used models and lesser-used models in this area. The study has been carried out considering ten well defined models that are ARIMA (auto-regressive integrated moving average), SARIMA (seasonal ARIMA), SES (single exponential smoothing), DES (double exponential smoothing), TES (triple exponential smoothing), ANN (artificial neural network), DT (decision tree), kNN (k-nearest neighbor), LSTM (long short-term memory) and MCFO (markov chain first order). A framework has been built that categories the models, implements them under identical execution environment and forecasts succeeding values. Implementation has been carried out over five data sets of real-world air pollution time series, that are collected from five differently located government setup monitoring stations over a period of 1 year (July 2018-June 2019). Rigorous statistical analysis has been performed that yields an insight to the nature and variability of these time series data. Forecasting has been carried out on short term basis, focusing on high granularity whereas, three different lengths of forecast horizon (1 day, 1 week, and 1 month) have been tested. Eventually, the models have been compared in terms of their associated performance measuring units namely, RMSE (root mean of squared error), MAE (mean absolute error) and MAPE (mean absolute percentage error). The comparative results verified with multiple datasets show that all the models posses less error for a shorter forecast horizon, where LSTM providing the best performance. Superiority of machine learning and deep learning models are found in case of longer length of forecast horizon with kNN achieving best accuracy whereas, significant performance degradation of ARIMA is found for longer forecast horizon. Moreover, TES, DT, kNN, LSTM, MCFO are found to be well adopted in relation with shape and variability of the data. Note that the performance on various length of high granular forecast horizon have been studied over multiple datasets that give an added value to this work. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Air pollution time series;

In this work the idea of “Grey-box” modelling is adopted in order to take most advantage of known information represented by deterministic structure, and then the neural grey system model is developed. Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is used to train the proposed model, and the Bayesian regularization is used to tune the regularized parameter automatically. Six real world case studies are presented to show the performance of the proposed model, comparing to 6 existing machine learning models and 17 grey system models. The results show that the proposed model can significantly overperform the other models and has very good generality, illustrating its high potential in a wide variety of real world applications and the efficiency of the proposed modelling method. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian regularization; Grey system model; Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm; Time series forecasting","System theory; Bayesian regularization; Black-box model; Grey system model; ITS applications; Large scale data sets; Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm; Machine learning models; Performance; Real-world; Time series forecasting; Machine learning; article; forecasting; Levenberg Marquardt algorithm; machine learning; time series analysis",,,,,"LeCun, Y., Bengio, Y., Hinton, G., Deep learning (2015) Nature, 521 (7553), pp. 436-444; (2016), David Silver, Aja Huang, Chris J Maddison, Arthur Guez, Laurent Sifre, George Van Den Driessche, Julian Schrittwieser, Ioannis Antonoglou, Veda Panneershelvam, Marc Lanctot, et al.

This work aims at predicting the future values of Ro-Ro perishable cargo flow at the Port of Algeciras Bay using a machine learning-based forecasting system. Two datasets consisting of daily records of fresh fruits and vegetables between 2010 to 2017 were analyzed. Additionally, these two—time series were pre-processed applying an exponential moving average method to obtain a smoothed version of the original ones. Multiple Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines, Long Short-Term Memory networks and an ensemble approach have been used to build a forecasting system and obtain the future values of the perishable cargo. The results of the analysis showed how this machine learning-based system achieved 14.83% better performance rate than a baseline persistence model in terms of root mean squared error in the fresh fruits dataset and 11.3% better in the vegetables one. In general, models’ average performance rates are better using the smoothed version of the times series rather than the original ones. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Decision support systems; Ensembles; Machine learning; Perishable maritime cargo; Time series forecasting","Decision making; Forecasting; Fruits; Linear regression; Mean square error; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Turing machines; Vegetables; Decision making process; Ensemble approaches; Exponential moving averages; Forecasting system; Maritime transport; Multiple linear regressions; Persistence models; Root mean squared errors; Learning systems; article; decision support system; forecasting; fruit; long short term memory network; support vector machine; time series analysis; vegetable",,,,,"Maksimavičius, R., (2004), Some elements of the Ro-Ro terminals, Transp.

It is a composite index consisting of five dimensions: economic, stability, social, development, and quality. This research conducts a data-driven analysis to provide prediction and time-series forecasting models for Pi-C to (1) monitor; and (2) provide guidance on how to improve the future health trajectory for the US construction industry. The seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) technique is applied for the future trend analysis; multiple linear regression (MLR) and random forests (RF) are applied for prediction models of Pi-C data analytics. It is expected that the proposed prediction and time-series forecasting models will help decision-makers, including policy developers and construction practitioners, to take necessary action in a timely manner, as well as open the discourse on the advanced application of analytics and data-driven decision-making in the construction industry. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Multiple linear regression (MLR); Prediction modeling; Purdue index for construction (Pi-C); Random forests (RF); SARIMA; Time-series forecasting","Construction industry; Data Analytics; Decision making; Decision trees; Forecasting; Linear regression; Time series; Time series analysis; Advanced applications; Data driven decision; Data-driven analysis; Multiple linear regressions; Policy developers; Prediction and forecasting; Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving averages; Time series forecasting models; Predictive analytics",,,,,"(2019) Construction Backlog Indicator, Definition and Methodology, , http://www.abc.org/Portals/1/Documents/CBI/CBIMethodology1.pdf, ABC (Associated Builders and Contractors).

Previous studies mainly model passenger flow as time series by aggregating individual trips and then perform forecasting based on the values in the past several steps. However, this approach essentially overlooks the fact that passenger flow consists of trips from each individual traveler. For example, a traveler's work trip in the morning can help predict his/her home trip in the evening, while this causal structure cannot be explicitly encoded in standard time series models. In this paper, we propose a new forecasting framework for boarding flow by incorporating the generative mechanism into standard time series models and leveraging the strong regularity rooted in travel behavior. In doing so, we introduce returning flow from previous alighting trips as a new covariate, which captures the causal structure and long-range dependencies in passenger flow data based on travel behavior. We develop the return probability parallelogram (RPP) to summarize the causal relationships and estimate the return flow. The proposed framework is evaluated using real-world passenger flow data, and the results confirm that the returning flow—a single covariate—can substantially and consistently improve various forecasting tasks, including one-step ahead forecasting, multi-step ahead forecasting, and forecasting under special events. And the proposed method is more effective for business-type stations with most passengers come and return within the same day. This study can be extended to other modes of transport, and it also sheds new light on general demand time series forecasting problems, in which causal structure and long-range dependencies are generated by the user behavior. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Public transport systems; Ridership forecasting; Smart card data; Time series; Travel behavior regularity","Behavioral research; Smart cards; Subways; Time series; Covariates; Passenger flows; Public transport systems; Ridership forecasting; Smart card data; Standard time; Times series; Times series models; Travel behavior regularity; Travel behaviour; Forecasting; forecasting method; metro system; public transport; time series analysis; transportation system; travel behavior; urban transport",,,,,"Akaike, H., Information theory and an extension of the maximum likelihood principle (1998) Selected papers of hirotugu akaike.

Technical analysis indicators are divided into three categories to construct multivariate fuzzy logical relationships. AP clustering without specifying the number of clusters is used to obtain a suitable partition for the universe of discourse, and the representative exemplars are generated as defuzzied values. The SVR model is employed to explore the unrecognized relationships and modify the forecasts. In addition, the error-based evaluation criteria are applied to evaluate the methods. The performance of the method is evaluated using the Taiwan Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX), Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P500), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms some classic models. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","AP clustering;

Quantitative prediction of rainfall time series is extremely challenging as compared to other meteorological parameters due to its variability in local features that involves temporal and spatial scales. Consequently, this requires a highly complex system having an advance model to accurately capture the highly non linear processes occurring in the climate. The focus of this work is direct prediction of multistep forecasting, where a separate time series model for each forecasting horizon is considered and forecasts are computed using observed data samples. Forecasting in this method is performed by proposing a deep learning approach, i.e, Temporal Deep Belief Network (DBN). The best model is selected from several baseline models on the basis of performance analysis metrics. The results suggest that the temporal DBN model outperforms the conventional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) specifically on rainfall time series forecasting. According to our experimentation, a modified DBN with hidden layes (300-200-100-10) performs best with 4.59E−05, 0.0068 and 0.94 values of MSE, RMSE and R value respectively on testing samples. However, we found that training DBN is more exhaustive and computationally intensive than other deep learning architectures. Findings of this research can be further utilized as basis for the advance forecasting of other weather parameters with same climate conditions.

The extended demand-supply gaps, depleting reservoirs of fossil fuel, and the environmental hazards altogether ignite the need for wider adoption of renewable energy resources for electricity generation. A functional assessment of the engineering design for this transition is a prerequisite before proceeding to on-ground implementation due to its high impact on system sustainability. To this end, we propose an agent-based modeling and simulation framework for the rapid prototyping of wind power plants. The proposed approach abstracts active components of wind power plants using agents and implements their dynamic behavior through agent interactions. The proposed model helps in composing different model components, design valuation, and forecasting energy generation in a cost-effective and productive manner. The proposed model is demonstrated by conceptualizing the design of the Foundation Wind Energy plant, located at Sindh, Pakistan, and the development of its agent-based model. The obtained short-term and long-term electricity generation profiles are validated with the actual data. We further compared the forecasts with the time series analysis performed on the actual data, using five different time-series forecasting models. The proposed simulation model and time series analysis model fit well on the actual data with a root mean square deviation of approximately 9 MW. The proposed framework will assist the policymakers in estimating the extent of electrical energy produced at given conditions using the wind potential available at the corridors of any country. It will further aid in the realistic analysis of the future dynamics of electricity demand and supply, hence help in effective energy planning. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agent-based approach; Forecasting; Modeling and simulation; Time series analysis; Wind power plants","Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Cost effectiveness; Developing countries; Electric power generation; Energy policy; Forecasting; Fossil fuel deposits; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Harmonic analysis; Population statistics; Simulation platform; Sustainable development; Wind power; Agent-based approach; Agent-based modeling and simulation; Electricity demands; Electricity generation; Environmental hazards; Root mean square deviations; System sustainability; Time series forecasting models; Time series analysis",,,,,"Abad, G., Lopez, J., Rodriguez, M., Marroyo, L., Iwanski, G., Doubly Fed Induction Machine: Modeling and Control for Wind Energy Generation, Vol. 85 (2011), John Wiley & Sons; Alvi, M.S.Q., Mahmood, I., Javed, F., Malik, A.W., Sarjoughian, H., Dynamic behavioural modeling, simulation and analysis of household water consumption in an urban area: a hybrid approach (2018) Proceedings of the 2018 Winter Simulation Conference, pp. 2411-2422. , IEEE Press Piscataway, NJ, USA; Calculations, W.T.P., Rwe Npower Renewables, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Power Industry (2012), The Royal Academy of Engineering; Castillo, M., Morales, G., Loyola, L.A., Singh, I., Calvo, C., Holland, H.L., MacLean, D.B., The alkaloids of L. paniculatum and the structure of paniculatine (1976) Can.

Due to the high volatility in the forex market, it is difficult to predict the future price of any currency pair. This study shows that a significant enhancement in the prediction of forex price can be achieved by incorporating domain knowledge in the process of training machine learning models. The proposed system integrates the Forex Loss Function (FLF) into a Long Short-Term Memory model called FLF-LSTM — that minimizes the difference between the actual and predictive average of Forex candles. Using the data of 10,078 four-hour candles of EURUSD pair, it is found that compared to the classic LSTM model, the proposed FLF-LSTM system shows a decrease in overall mean absolute error rate by 10.96%. It is also reported that the error in forecasting the high and low prices is reduced by 10% and 9%, respectively. The proposed model, in comparison to the Recurrent Neural Network-based prediction system, shows an overall reduction of 73.57% in mean absolute error, by exhibiting up to 68.71% and 72.31% error reduction in high and low prices, respectively. In comparison to Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average, our proposed model shows a 13% reduced error. Specifically, in the open, high, and low prices, the error is reduced by 28.5%, 14.2%, 9.3%, respectively. Finally, we compare our model with another well-known time series forecasting model, i.e., FB Prophet — where FLF-LSTM demonstrates 31.8%, 47.7%, 23.6%, 47.7% error reduction in open, high, low, and close prices, respectively.

In modern time series analysis, sequential pattern mining (SPM) and association discovery (AD) are the most important techniques to predict the future trends. This study aims at developing advanced SPM and AD for financial data by cutting edge techniques from artificial intelligence and machine learning. The nonlinearity and non-stationarity of financial time series dynamics pose a major challenge for SPM and AD. This study employs time–frequency analysis to extract features for SPM. Then, a sparse multi-manifold clustering (SMMC) is used to partition the feature space into several disjointed regions for better AD. Finally, local relevance vector machines (RVMs) are employed for AD and perform the forecasting. Different from traditional methods, the novel forecasting system operates on multiple resolutions and multiple dynamic regimes. SMMC finds both the neighbors and the weights automatically by a sparse solution, which approximately spans a low-dimensional affine subspace at that point. RVM, the Bayesian kernel machines, can produce parsimonious models with excellent generalization properties. Taking multiple time series data from financial markets as an example, the empirical results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms traditional models and significantly reduces the forecasting errors. The framework is effective and suitable for other time series forecasting. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Kernel machine; Local modeling; Manifold clustering; Multi-scale representation; Time–frequency analysis","Data mining; E-learning; Electronic trading; Finance; Forecasting; Machine learning; Frequency Analysis; Kernel machine; Local model; Manifold clustering; Multiscale representations; Time series analysis",,,,,"Atsalakis, G., Valavanis, K., Surveying stock market forecasting techniques–part II: soft computing methods (2009) Expert Syst Appl, 36 (3), pp. 5932-5941; Atsalakis, G., Valavanis, K., Surveying stock market forecasting techniques—part I: Conventional Methods.

To assure the satisfaction of such standards a set of quality sensors that monitor continuously the Water Distribution System (WDS) are used. Unfortunately, those sensors require continuous maintenance in order to guarantee their right and reliable operation. In order to program the maintenance of those sensors taking into account the health state of the sensor, a prognosis system should be deployed. Moreover, before proceeding with the prognosis of the sensors, the data provided with those sensors should be validated using data from other sensors and models. This paper provides an advanced data analytics framework that will allow us to diagnose water quality sensor faults and to detect water quality events. Moreover, a data-driven prognosis module will be able to assess the sensitivity degradation of the chlorine sensors estimating the remaining useful life (RUL), taking into account uncertainty quantification, that allows us to program the maintenance actions based on the state of health of sensors instead on a regular basis. The fault and event detection module is based on a methodology that combines time and spatial models obtained from historical data that are integrated with a discrete-event system and are able to distinguish between a quality event or a sensor fault. The prognosis module analyses the quality sensor time series forecasting the degradation and therefore providing a predictive maintenance plan avoiding unsafe situations in the WDS. © 2020 by the authors.

In this study, we propose a multivariate financial time-series forecasting method. Our model addresses the long- and short-term features, multimodal and non-stationarity nature of multivariate time-series by incorporating the improved deep neural networks and certified noise injection. Specifically, multimodal variational autoencoder is used to extract deep high-level features of multivariate time-series, Long- and Short- Term recurrent neural network is applied for multivariate time-series forecasting, and certified noise injection mechanism, inspired by differential privacy, is proposed to improve the robustness and accuracy of prediction. Extensive empirical results on real-world agricultural commodity futures price time series and relevant external data demonstrate that our model achieves better performance over that of several state-of-the-art baseline methods. © 2013 IEEE.","deep neural networks; Futures prices; Gaussian noise; multivariate; prediction","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Deep neural networks; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Investments; Recurrent neural networks; Time series analysis; Agricultural commodity futures; Differential privacies; Financial time series forecasting; Financial time series predictions; High-level features; Learning approach; Multivariate time series; Non-stationarities; Time series",,,,,"Wang, D., Yue, C., Wei, S., Lv, J., Performance analysis of four decomposition-ensemble models for One-Day-Ahead agricultural commodity futures price forecasting (2017) Algorithms, 10 (3), p. 108. , Sep; Ouyang, H., Wei, X., Wu, Q., Agricultural commodity futures prices prediction via long-and short-term time series network (2019) J.

In this paper, we present a new type 2 fuzzy time series forecasting model based on three-factors fuzzy logical relationship groups. The proposed method uses a new technique to define partitions the universe of discourse into different length of intervals for different factors. Also, the proposed method fuzzifies the historical data sets of the main factors, second factors and third factors to their maximum membership grades obtained by their corresponding triangular fuzzy sets and construct the fuzzy logical relationship groups which is based on the three-factors to enhance in the forecasting accuracy rates. This paper introduces a new defuzzification technique based on their frequency occurrences of fuzzy logical relationships in fuzzy logical relationship groups. The fitness of the propose method is verified in the forecasting of Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) Sensex historical data and compare in terms of root mean square and average forecasting errors which indicates that the proposed method produce more accurate forecasted output over the existing models in fuzzy time series. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.","BSE Sensex data set; Fuzzy time series; three-factors fuzzy logical relationships; triangular fuzzy numbers (TFN); type 2 fuzzy","Electronic trading; Forecasting; Fuzzy sets; Time series; Time series analysis; Data set; Fuzzy logical relationships; Fuzzy time series; Triangular fuzzy numbers; Type-2 fuzzy; Fuzzy logic",,,,,"Zadeh, L.A., Fuzzy sets (1965) Inf.

Relational time series learning lies at the intersection of traditional time series analysis and statistical relational learning, and bridges the gap between these two fundamentally important problems. This paper formulates the relational time series learning problem, and a general framework and taxonomy for representation discovery tasks of both nodes and links including predicting their existence, label, and weight (importance), as well as systematically constructing features. We also reinterpret the prediction task leading to the proposal of two important relational time series forecasting tasks consisting of (i) relational time series classification (predicts a future class or label of an entity), and (ii) relational time series regression (predicts a future real-valued attribute or weight). Relational time series models are designed to leverage both relational and temporal dependencies to minimize forecasting error for both relational time series classification and regression. Finally, we discuss challenges and open problems that remain to be addressed. © Cambridge University Press, 2018.",,"Forecasting; Learning systems; Biological domain; Forecasting error; Nodes and links;

However, non-stationarity and non-linearity of most financial time series often make these tasks difficult to perform. In this paper, we propose a methodology based on chaos and dynamical systems theory for non-linear time series forecasting and investment strategy development, which is able to correctly make predictions at long time horizons. We construct Constant Chaoticity Portfolios (CCP) and evaluate their performances on the survival components of the STOXX Europe 50 index and the Hang-Seng index. Results show that the CCP overwhelms several competing alternatives, both in terms of net profits and risk-return profiles.

In this work, we propose a new complete framework for enhancing deep learning time-series models, which is based on a data preprocessing methodology. The proposed framework focuses on conducting a sequence of transformations on the original low-quality time-series data for generating high-quality time-series data, “suitable” for efficiently training and fitting a deep learning model. These transformations are performed in two successive stages: The first stage is based on the smoothing technique for the development of a new de-noised version of the original series in which every value contains dynamic knowledge of the all previous values. The second stage of transformations is performed on the smoothed series and it is based on differencing the series in order to be stationary and be considerably easier fitted and analyzed by a deep learning model. A number of experiments were performed utilizing time-series datasets from the cryptocurrency market, energy sector and financial stock market application domains on both regression and classification problems. The comprehensive numerical experiments and statistical analysis provide empirical evidence that the proposed framework considerably improves the forecasting performance of a deep learning model. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Deep Learning; Forecasting; Stationarity; Time-series","Classification (of information); Commerce; Data mining; Forecasting; Learning systems; Time series analysis; Data preprocessing; Forecasting performance; Forecasting problems; Learning models; Market applications; Numerical experiments; Smoothing techniques; Time-series data; Deep learning",,,,,"Weigend, A.S., (2018) Time series prediction: forecasting the future and understanding the past, , Routledge, London; Brockwell Peter, J., Brockwell Peter, J., Davis Richard, A., Davis Richard, A., (2016) Introduction to time series and forecasting, , Springer, Berlin; Berry Lindsay, R., Paul, H., Mike, W., Probabilistic forecasting of heterogeneous consumer transaction-sales time series (2019) Int J Forecast, 36, p. 552; Nunnari Valeria, N.G., Forecasting monthly sales retail time series: A case study (2017) 2017 IEEE 19Th Conference on Business Informatics (CBI), 1, pp. 1-6. , IEEE; Time-series and cross-sectional momentum and contrarian strategies within the commodity futures markets (2017) Cogent Econ Financ, 5 (1), p. 1339772; Livieris, I.E., Pintelas, E., Kiriakidou, N., Stavroyiannis, S., An advanced deep learning model for short-term forecasting U.S. natural gas price and movement (2020) IFIP International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations, pp. 165-176. , Springer, Berlin; Walter, E., (2008) Applied econometric time series, , Wiley, New York; Pesaran Hashem, M., (2015) Time series and panel data econometrics, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Box George, E.P., Jenkins Gwilym, M., Reinsel Gregory, C., Ljung Greta, M., (2015) Time series analysis: forecasting and control, , Wiley, New York; Tsay Ruey, S., (2005) Analysis of financial time series, 543. , Wiley, New York; Livieris Ioannis, E., Stavros, S., Emmanuel, P., Panagiotis, P., A novel validation framework to enhance deep learning models in time-series forecasting (2020) Neural Comput Appl, 32, p. 17149; Van Dick, D., Timo, T., Hans, F.P., Smooth transition autoregressive models: a survey of recent developments (2002) Econ Rev, 21 (1), pp. 1-47; Uwe, H., Autoregressive moving average processes (ARMA) (2016) Stochastic Processes and Calculus, pp. 45-75. , Springer, Berlin; Neusser, K., Autoregressive moving-average models (2016) Time Series Econometrics, pp. 25-44. , Springer, Berlin; Chirag, D., Fan, Z., Junjing, Y., Eang, L.S., Wei, S.K., A review on time series forecasting techniques for building energy consumption (2017) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 74, pp. 902-924; Trevor, F., Christophe, M., An empirical comparison of classification algorithms for mortgage default prediction: evidence from a distressed mortgage market (2016) Eur J Oper Res, 249 (2), pp. 427-439; Pintelas, E., Livieris, I.E., Stavroyiannis, S., Kotsilieris, T., Pintelas, P., Investigating the problem of cryptocurrency price prediction—a deep learning approach (2020) IFIP International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations, pp. 99-110. , Springer, Berlin; Chowdhury, R., Rahman, M.A., Rahman, M.S., Mahdy, M.R.C., (2019) Predicting and Forecasting the Price of Constituents and Index of Cryptocurrency Using Machine Learning.

While no single time series modeling method is universal to all types of dynamics, forecasting using an ensemble of several methods is often seen as a compromise. Instead of fixing ensemble diversity and size, we propose to predict these aspects adaptively using meta-learning. Meta-learning here considers two separate random forest regression models, built on 390 time-series features, to rank 22 univariate forecasting methods and recommend ensemble size. The forecasting ensemble is consequently formed from methods ranked as the best, and forecasts are pooled using either simple or weighted average (with a weight corresponding to reciprocal rank). The proposed approach was tested on 12561 micro-economic time-series (expanded to 38633 for various forecasting horizons) of M4 competition where meta-learning outperformed Theta and Comb benchmarks by relative forecasting errors for all data types and horizons. Best overall results were achieved by weighted pooling with a symmetric mean absolute percentage error of 9.21% versus 11.05% obtained using the Theta method. © 2013 IEEE.","Business intelligence; forecasting ensemble; M4 competition; meta-learning; random forest; univariate time-series model","Decision trees; Regression analysis; Time series; Time series analysis; Economic time series; Forecasting error; Forecasting methods; Mean absolute percentage error; Single time series; Time series features; Time series forecasting; Weighted averages; Forecasting",,,,,"Hyndman, R.J., Business forecasting methods (2010) Proc.

Crime forecasting using time series is an efficient statistical tool for predicting rates of crime in many countries around the world. Crime data can be useful to determine the efficacy of crime prevention steps and the safety of cities and societies. However, it is a difficult task to predict the crime accurately because the number of crimes is increasing day by day. The objective of this study is to apply time series to predict the crime rate to facilitate practical crime prevention solutions. Machine learning can play an important role to better understand and analyze the future trend of violations. Different time-series forecasting models have been used to predict the crime. These forecasting models are trained to predict future violent crimes. The proposed approach outperforms other forecasting techniques for daily and monthly forecast.

Auto-regression is one of the most common approaches to address these problems. Accordingly, observations are modelled by multiple regression using their past lags as predictor variables. We investigate the extension of auto-regressive processes using statistics which summarise the recent past dynamics of time series. The result of our research is a novel framework called VEST, designed to perform feature engineering using univariate and numeric time series automatically. The proposed approach works in three main steps. First, recent observations are mapped onto different representations. Second, each representation is summarised by statistical functions. Finally, a filter is applied for feature selection. We discovered that combining the features generated by VEST with auto-regression significantly improves forecasting performance in a database composed by 90 time series with high sampling frequency. However, we also found that there are no improvements when the framework is applied for multi-step forecasting or in time series with low sample size. VEST is publicly available online. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Automatic machine learning; Feature engineering; Time series forecasting","Forecasting; Time series analysis; Auto regressive process; Feature engineerings; Forecasting performance; High sampling frequencies; Multi-step forecasting; Multiple regressions; Statistical functions; Time series forecasting; Time series",,,,,"Barandas, M., Folgado, D., Fernandes, L., Santos, S., Abreu, M., Bota, P., Liu, H., Gamboa, H., Tsfel: Time series feature extraction library (2020) SoftwareX, 11, p. 100456; Benavoli, A., Corani, G., Demšar, J., Zaffalon, M., Time for a change: A tutorial for comparing multiple classifiers through bayesian analysis (2017) The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 18 (1), pp. 2653-2688; Box, G.E., Jenkins, G.M., Reinsel, G.C., Ljung, G.M., (2015) Time series analysis: Forecasting and control, , Wiley; Box, G.E., Pierce, D.A., Distribution of residual autocorrelations in autoregressive-integrated moving average time series models (1970) Journal of the American Statistical Association, 65 (332), pp. 1509-1526; Brennan, M., Palaniswami, M., Kamen, P., Do existing measures of poincare plot geometry reflect nonlinear features of heart rate variability?

As the volume of historical data increases, powerful forecasting techniques that reveal unknown relationships between past and future values are required to provide accurate forecasts of production and sales. Thus, in this paper, a composite GRU-Prophet model with an attention mechanism was constructed to predict sales volume. In this composite model, Prophet model and GRU model with attention mechanism were used to capture linear and nonlinear features, respectively. The composite model was experimentally determined to be more applicable and to provide more accurate predictions than did recurrent neural network, long short-term memory, gate recurrent unit, Prophet, and autoregressive integrated moving average models. This study's composite model is suited to rapid changes in market demand and helps enterprises be more competitive in the field of smart manufacturing.

Under this highly relevant and extensive heading, an approach is proposed to improve vehicle detection in smart crosswalks using machine learning models. Contrarily to classic fuzzy classifiers, machine learning models do not require the readjustment of labels that depend on the location of the system and the road conditions. Several machine learning models were trained and tested using real traffic data taken from urban scenarios in both Portugal and Spain. These include random forest, time-series forecasting, multi-layer perceptron, support vector machine, and logistic regression models. A deep reinforcement learning agent, based on a state-of-the-art double-deep recurrent Q-network, is also designed and compared with the machine learning models just mentioned. Results show that the machine learning models can efficiently replace the classic fuzzy classifier. © 2020 by the authors.

India implemented a complete shutdown across the nation from March 25, 2020 as lockdown I and went on to extend it by giving timely partial relaxations in the form of lockdown II, III & IV. This paper statistically analyses the impact of relaxation during Lockdown III and IV on coronavirus disease (COVID) spread in India using the Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) to forecast the number of active cases using time series analysis and hence the required medical infrastructure for the period of next six months. The Group Method of Data Handling is a novel self organized data mining technique with data driven adaptive learning capability which grasps the auto correlative relations between the samples and gives a high forecasting accuracy irrespective of the length and stochasticity of a time series. The GMDH model has been first validated and standardized by forecasting the number of active and confirmed cases during lockdown III-IV with an accuracy of 2.58% and 2.00% respectively. Thereafter, the number of active cases has been forecasted for the rest of 2020 to predict the impact of lockdown relaxation on spread of COVID-19 and indicate preparatory measures necessary to counter it. © 2020","COVID-19; Group method of data handling; Time series forecasting","Data mining; Experimental reactors; Forecasting; Time series analysis; Adaptive learning; Coronaviruses; Effective measures; Forecasting accuracy; Group method of data handling; Medical infrastructure; Statistically analysis; Stochasticity; Data handling",,,,,"Taubenberger, J.K., Morens, D.M., 1918 Influenza: the mother of all pandemics (2006) Emerg Infect Dis, 12, pp. 15-22. , [CrossRef] [PubMed]; https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Situation Report–94, World Health Organization (WHO), 23/04/2020.; 2020 [accessed 23 April 2020]; Carlos, W.G., Cruz, C.S.D., Cao, B., Pasnick, S., Jamil, S., Novel Wuhan (2019-nCoV) coronavirus (2020) Am J Respir Crit Care Med, 201, pp. 7-8; Lu, R., Zhao, X., Li, J., Niu, P., Yang, B., Wu, H., Genomic characterization and epidemiologyof 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding (2020) Lancet, 395 (10224), pp. 565-574; Ren, L.L., Wang, Y.M., Wu, Z.Q., Xiang, Z.C., Guo, L., Xu, T., Identification of a novelcoronavirus causing severe pneumonia in human: a descriptive study (2020) Chin Med J, , In Press; https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/coronavirus-in-india-tracking-country-s-first-50-covid-19-cases-what-numbers-tell-1654468-2020-03-12, Coronavirus in India: Tracking country's first 50 COVID-19 cases; what numbers tell.; 2020 [accessed 25 June 2020]; https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Situation Report162, World Health Organization (WHO), 30/06/2020.; 2020 [accessed 30 June 2020]; https://www.cdc.gov/, Transmission of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) | CDC.; 2020 [accessed 30 April 2020]; Jaimes, J.A., Millet, J.K., Stout, A.E., Andre, N.M., Whittaker, G.R., A tale of two viruses: the distinct spike glycoproteins of feline coronaviruses (2020) Viruses, 12, p. 83; Belouzard, S., Chu, V.C., Whittaker, G.R., Activation of the SARS coronavirus spikeprotein via sequential proteolytic cleavage at two distinct sites (2009) Proc Natl Acad Sci U SA, 106, pp. 5871-5876; https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/, Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Situation Report-7, World Health Organization (WHO), 27/01/2020.; 2020 [accessed 30 April 2020]; Ferguson, N., Laydon, D., Gilani, G.N., Imai, N., Ainslie, K., Baguelin, M., Bhatia, S., Dannenburg, G.C., (2020), Report 9: impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (npis) to reduce COVID19 mortality and healthcare demand; Yule, G.U., On the method of investigating periodicities in disturbed series, with special reference to Wolf's sunspot numbers (1927) Philos Trans R Soc Lond Ser A, 226, pp. 267-298; Kolmogorov, A.N., Stationary sequences in Hilbert space (in Russian) (1941) Bull Math Univ Moscow, 2 (6), pp. 1-40; Box, G.E.P., Jenkins, G., Time series analysis, forecasting and control (1976), Holden-Day San Francisco, CA; Teng, Y., Bi, D., Xie, G., Jin, Y., Huang, Y., Lin, B., An, X., Tong, Y., Dynamic forecasting of zika epidemics using google trends (2017) PLoS ONE, 12 (1); Li, X., Kang, D., Zhang, Y., Wei, G., Liu, W., Epidemic trend of measles in Shandong province, China, 1963–2005 (2012) Public Health, 126 (12), pp. 1017-1023; Pelat, C., Boe¨lle, P.Y., Cowling, B.J., Carrat, F., Flahault, A., Online detection and quantification of epidemics (2007) BMC Med Inform Decis Mak, 7 (29); Wu, T., Ge, X., Yu, G., Hu, E., Open-source analytics tools for studying the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak (2020) medRxiv; Chintalapudi, N., Battineni, G., Amenta, F., COVID-19 virus outbreak forecasting of registered and recovered cases after sixty day lockdown in Italy: a data driven model approach (2020) J Microbiol Immunol Infect, , [In press]; Chakraborty, T., Ghosh, I., Real-time forecasts and risk assessment of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) cases: a data-driven analysis (2020) Chaos Solitons Fractals, , April; Gupta, R., Pal, S.K., Trend Analysis and forecasting of COVID-19 outbreak in India.

Conventional methods of stock return forecasting mainly fall into two categories: Technical Analysis and Fundamental Analysis. Technical Analysis focuses on time-series data, while Fundamental Analysis explores low-frequency fundamental variables. Although there are substantial works on either time-series analysis or fundamental analysis, few studies have enriched the time-series forecasting with fundamental variables, as the features are characterized by different frequencies, scales and types. In this paper, we propose a Long Short-Term Memory and Deep Neural Network (LSTM-DNN) hybrid model to integrate the fundamental information into time-series forecasting tasks. We demonstrate how investors can benefit from the superior performance of LSTM-DNN by constructing a long-short portfolio that takes long positions in stocks with the highest forecasting returns and short positions in stocks that are expected to decline. Extensive experimental results on real data show that our novel framework could improve the profitability of long-short portfolio strategies compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. We also find evidence indicating that the outperformance of LSTM-DNN model comes from its enhanced ability to extract information from the nonlinear relations among various features, rather than bearing more market risks. Besides the novel framework, we propose a cross-section normalization method, which benefits the framework by providing enriched cross-section signals. © 2013 IEEE.","Hybrid deep neural networks; long-short portfolio strategy; security returns forecasting","Deep neural networks; Financial markets; Forecasting; Investments; Long short-term memory; Conventional methods; Extract informations; Fundamental analysis; Long-short portfolio; Normalization methods; State-of-the-art approach; Stock return forecasting; Time series forecasting; Time series analysis",,,,,"Bollerslev, T., Marrone, J., Xu, L., Zhou, H., Stock return predictability and variance risk premia: Statistical inference and international evidence (2014) J.

Multicast is increasingly being used to carry uncompressed video in media data centers with very large bandwidth requirements per flow. Multicast control protocols such as IGMP and PIM build multicast trees without trying to maximize the overall fabric capacity, leading to decreased fabric utilization and inability to service flows. In addition, existing multicast protocols are not bandwidth-aware and could cause links to over-subscribe leading to packet loss and negative user quality of experience. In this paper, we formulate offline optimization for multicast trees in clos fabric. We then design and implement two novel algorithms, iRP and LiRP, to optimize multicast tree formation and increase overall fabric multicast capacity. iRP algorithm optimizes online formation of multicast trees while addressing bandwidth requirements using SDN controller. We share analysis of TV studio repetitive traffic patterns the benefits of time series forecasting to predict multicast group membership and bring online optimization efficiency closer to offline optimization results. We then implement and test LiRP algorithm to increases iRP's fabric efficiency by implementing k-fold cross validation method to predict future multicast group memberships leading to optimized multicast tree placement. We implement iRP and LiRP algorithms using controller-based system and test both algorithms using Cisco Nexus commercially available switches. Testing results confirm that iRP Algorithm increases fabric capacity by 60% compared to PIM performance. LiRP system increases the efficiency of iRP by up to 40% through prediction of multicast group memberships with online arrival. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","controller; dc fabric; Multicast; neural networks; optimization; uncompressed video","Bandwidth; Controllers; Efficiency; Forecasting; Forestry; Neural networks; Optimization; Quality of service; Switching networks; Time series analysis; Trees (mathematics); K fold cross validations; Multicast control protocols; Multicast optimization; Multicast tree formation; Off-line optimization; Quality of experience (QoE); Time series forecasting; uncompressed video; Multicasting",,,,,"Nicholas, J., Adams, A., Siadak, W., Protocol independent multicast-dense mode (PIM-DM): Protocol specification (revised) (2005) IETF, RFC, 3973. , Jan; Lambadaris, I., Craig, A., Nandy, B., Ashwood-Smith, P., Load balancing for multicast traffic in SDN using real-time link cost modification (2015) Proc.

The objective of this research is to improve the performances of the fuzzy transform-based prediction method applied to seasonal time series. The time series’ trend is obtained via polynomial fitting: then, the dataset is partitioned in S seasonal subsets and the direct F1-transform components for each seasonal subset are calculated as well. The inverse F1-transforms are used to predict the value of the weather parameter in the future. We test our method on heat index datasets obtained from daily weather data measured from weather stations of the Campania Region (Italy) during the months of July and August from 2003 to 2017. We compare the results obtained with the statistics Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Automatic Design of Artificial Neural Networks (ADANN), and the seasonal F-transform methods, showing that the best results are just given by our approach. © 2019 by the authors.

The purpose of this paper is to propose a Taylor series approximation and unbiased GM(1,1) based new hybrid statistical approach (HTS_UGM(1,1)) for forecasting time series data under the poor, incomplete and uncertain information systems in a short period of time manner. Design/methodology/approach: The gray forecasting is a dynamical methodology which can be classified into different categories based on their respective functions. The new proposed methodology is made up of three different methodologies including the first-order unbiased GM(1,1), Markov chain and Taylor approximation. In addition to that, two different traditional gray operational mechanisms include GM(1,1) and unbiased GM(1,1) used as the comparisons. The main objective of this study is to forecast gold price demands in a short-term manner based on the data which were taken from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka from October 2017 to December 2017. Findings: The error analysis results suggested that the new proposed HTS_UGM(1,1) is highly accurate (less than 10 percent) with lowest RMSE error values in a one head as well as weakly forecasting’s than separate gray forecasting methodologies. Originality/value: The findings suggested that the new proposed hybrid approach is more suitable and effective way for forecasting time series indices than separate time series forecasting methodologies in a short-term manner. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Grey mechanism;

We propose a double-stage model that forecasts traffic. The hybrid model is based on quantitative tools. First, we search for associations in data and then, we develop a time series analysis. The specific objectives of the study are firstly to survey and collect data at a disaggregated level in terms of passenger and vehicle flows and time periods; and secondly, to develop forecasts on short-term using a combination of the proposed techniques. We think that the simultaneous application of historical analogy and time series forecasting is a powerful tool to predict the future traffic. Additionally, the methodological procedure proposed in this paper is general enough to be applied to other traffics and ports.

Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model has been one of the most widely used linear models in time series forecasting but ARIMA model cannot capture nonlinear patterns easily. Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model applied understanding of volatility depending to the estimation of previous forecast error and current volatility, improving ARI-MA model. Support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) have been successfully applied in solving nonlinear regression estimation problems. This study proposes hybrid methodology that exploits unique strength of GARCH + SVM model, and GARCH + ANN model in forecasting stock index. Real data sets of stock prices FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI were used to examine the forecasting accuracy of the proposed model.

The application of standard SOM, and its variants, to time series prediction has been studied in the literature under different conditions and techniques. In this paper, we have focused on the standard Self-Organizing Maps, and its application for time series forecasting. We provide extensive numerical analysis considering regular and complex topologies, and real time series. Concretely, we study the impact of the number of neurons, the effect of the best-matching unit over its neighborhood, the use of nonlinear learning rate functions, and the importance of a proportional training together with a sampled input space as uniformly as possible. We have found that probabilistic updating in neighborhoods may be used as a second learning rate parameter within the SOM. We have also found that small-world and scale-free topologies are able to improve the error of regular lattices, depending on their own set of parameters, the number of neurons, and the length of the training set. Finally, we have found coherence between results of real time series and analytic benchmarks for forecasting. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Complex networks; Self-organizing maps (SOM); Time series prediction","Complex networks; Conformal mapping; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Network architecture; Neural networks; Neurons; Time series; Time series analysis; Topology; Application of standards; Best matching units; Competitive learning; Nonlinear learning; Scale-free topologies; Time series forecasting; Time series prediction; Topology-based analysis; Self organizing maps",,,,,"Abinader, F.M., de Queiroz, A.C.S., Honda, D.W., Self-organized hierarchical methods for time series forecasting.

The data set used is an API data provided by the John Hopkins University resource centre and used the Web crawler to gather all the data features such as confirmed, recovered and death cases. Because of the unavailability of any COVID-19 drug at the moment, the unvarnished truth is that this outbreak is not expected to end in the near future, so the number of cases of this study would be very date specific. The analysis demonstrated in this paper focuses on the monthly analysis of confirmed, recovered and death cases, which assists to identify the trend and seasonality in the data. The purpose of this study is to explore the essential concepts of time series algorithms and use those concepts to perform time series analysis on the infected cases worldwide and forecast the spread of the virus in the next two weeks and thus aid in health-care services. Lower obtained mean absolute percentage error results of the forecasting time interval validate the model’s credibility. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, the time series analysis of this outbreak forecast was done using the auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and also seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving averages with exogenous regressor (SARIMAX) and optimized to achieve better results. Findings: The inferences of time series forecasting models ARIMA and SARIMAX were efficient to produce exact approximate results. The forecasting results indicate that an increasing trend is observed and there is a high rise in COVID-19 cases in many regions and countries that might face one of its worst days unless and until measures are taken to curb the spread of this disease quickly. The pattern of the rise of the spread of the virus in such countries is exactly mimicking some of the countries of early COVID-19 adoption such as Italy and the USA. Further, the obtained numbers of the models are date specific so the most recent execution of the model would return more recent results. The future scope of the study involves analysis with other models such as long short-term memory and then comparison with time series models.

In this situation, an accurate urban building energy model (UBEM) is the foundation to support the design of energy-efficient communities. However, current UBEM are ineffective to capture the inter-building interdependency due to their dynamic and non-linear characteristics. Those conventional models either ignored or oversimplified these building interdependencies, which can substantially affect the accuracy of urban energy modeling. To fill the research gap, this study proposes a novel data-driven UBEN synthesizing the solar-based building interdependency and spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) algorithm. Especially, we took a university campus located in the downtown area of Atlanta as an example to predict the hourly energy consumption. Furthermore, we tested the feasibility of the ST-GCN model by comparing the performance of the ST-GCN model with other common time-series machine learning models. The results indicate that the ST-GCN model overall outperforms in different scenarios, the mean absolute percentage error of ST-GCN is around 5%. More importantly, the accuracy of ST-GCN is enhanced when simulating buildings with higher edge weight and in-degrees, this phenomenon is magnified in summer daytime and winter daytime, which validated the interpretability of the ST-GCN models. After discussion, it is found that data-driven models integrated with engineering or physics knowledge can significantly improve urban building energy use prediction. © 2021","Building interdependency; Graph neural network; Time-series prediction; Urban-scale building simulation","Buildings; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Time series; Building interdependency; Building simulation; Convolutional networks; Graph neural networks; Network models; Spatio-temporal graphs; Time series prediction; Urban buildings; Urban scale; Urban-scale building simulation; Graph neural networks; artificial neural network; energy use; forecasting method; machine learning; residential energy; time series analysis; urban area; Atlanta; Georgia; United States",,,,,"Huo, T., Ma, Y., Cai, W., Liu, B., Mu, L., Will the urbanization process influence the peak of carbon emissions in the building sector?

However, compared with aggregated load forecasting, household load forecasting faces the challenge of the uncertainty of prolific load profiles. This paper presents a novel multiple cycles self-boosted neural network (MultiCycleNet) framework for household load forecasting, which aims to solve the uncertainty problem of household load profiles through the correlation analysis of electricity consumption patterns in multiple cycles. The basic idea of the proposed framework is that the predictor can learn customers’ power consumption patterns better by learning the features and contextual information of relevant load profiles in multiple historical cycles. We use two real-life datasets: 1. the household load consumption dataset from Low Carbon London project led by United Kingdom (UK) Power Networks and 2. the UK Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity (UK-DALE) dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, experimental results show that the proposed framework is effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 19.83%, 10.46%, 11.14% and 9.02% in terms of mean squared error, root mean squared error, mean absolute error and mean absolute percent error, respectively. © 2021","Load forecasting;

The constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is a fundamental concept of metaheuristics that has shown great efficiency in several fields. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are powerful machine learning algorithms that are applied especially frequently in time series analysis. However, one issue in forecasting time series using HMMs is how to reduce the search space (state and observation space). To address this issue, we propose a graph-based big data optimization approach using a CSP to enhance the results of learning and prediction tasks of HMMs. This approach takes full advantage of both HMMs, with the richness of their algorithms, and CSPs, with their many powerful and efficient solver algorithms. To verify the validity of the model, the proposed approach is evaluated on real-world data using the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and other metrics as measures of the prediction accuracy. The conducted experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the conventional model. It reduces the MAPE by 0.71% and offers a particularly good trade-off between computational costs and the quality of results for large datasets. It is also competitive with benchmark models in terms of the running time and prediction accuracy. Further comparisons substantiate these experimental findings. © 2021, The Author(s).","Big data analytics; Graphical modeling; Machine learning; Metaheuristics; Optimization; Time series forecasting",,,,,,"Luengo, J., García-Gil, D., Ramírez-Gallego, S., García, S., Herrera, F., (2020) Big data preprocessing, p. 186. , 1, Springer, Switzerland AG; Tsai, C.W., Lai, C.F., Chao, H.C., Vasilakos, A.V., Big data analytics: a survey (2015) J Big Data., 2 (1), pp. 1-31; El-Alfy, E.S.M., Mohammed, S.A., A review of machine learning for big data analytics: bibliometric approach (2020) Technol Anal Strateg Manag., 32 (8), pp. 984-1005; Hariri, R.H., Fredericks, E.M., Bowers, K.M., Uncertainty in big data analytics: survey, opportunities, and challenges (2019) J Big Data., 6 (1), pp. 1-16; Lee, I., Big data: Dimensions, evolution, impacts, and challenges (2017) Business Horizons., 60 (3), pp. 293-303; Sassi, I., Anter, S., Bekkhoucha, A., An overview of big data and machine learning paradigms (2018) Int Conf Adv Intell Syst Sustain Dev, 915, pp. 237-251; Seethalakshmi, V., Govindasamy, V., Akila, V., Hybrid gradient descent spider monkey optimization (HGDSMO) algorithm for efficient resource scheduling for big data processing in heterogenous environment (2020) J Big Data., 7 (1), pp. 1-25; Al Jallad, K., Aljnidi, M., Desouki, M.S., Anomaly detection optimization using big data and deep learning to reduce false-positive (2020) J Big Data., 7 (1), pp. 1-12; Abualigah, L., Diabat, A., Mirjalili, S., Abd Elaziz, M., Gandomi, A.H., The arithmetic optimization algorithm (2021) Comput Methods Appl Mech Eng., 376, p. 113609; Emrouznejad, A., (2018); Dhaenens, C., Jourdan, L., (2016) Metaheuristics for Big Data, p. 212. , https://doi.org/10.1002/9781119347569, London, Wiley Online Library; Chopard, B., Tomassini, M., (2018) An Introduction to Metaheuristics for Optimization, p. 266. , https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-93073-2, 1st ed.

In this paper, a new DO hybrid forecasting model is proposed that includes three stages: multi-factor analysis, adaptive decomposition, and an optimization-based ensemble. First, considering the complex factors affecting DO, the grey relational (GR) degree method is used to screen out the environmental factors most closely related to DO. The consideration of multiple factors makes model fusion more effective. Second, the series of DO, water temperature, salinity, and oxygen saturation are decomposed adaptively into sub-series by means of the empirical wavelet transform (EWT) method. Then, five benchmark models are utilized to forecast the sub-series of EWT decomposition. The ensemble weights of these five sub-forecasting models are calculated by particle swarm optimization and gravitational search algorithm (PSOGSA). Finally, a multi-factor ensemble model for DO is obtained by weighted allocation. The performance of the proposed model is verified by time-series data collected by the pacific islands ocean observing system (PacIOOS) from the WQB04 station at Hilo. The evaluation indicators involved in the experiment include the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE), mean absolute percent error (MAPE), standard deviation of error (SDE), and coefficient of determination (R2). Example analysis demonstrates that: ① The proposed model can obtain excellent DO forecasting results; ② the proposed model is superior to other comparison models; and ③ the forecasting model can be used to analyze the trend of DO and enable managers to make better management decisions. © 2021 THE AUTHORS","Dissolved oxygen concentrations forecasting;

This commercial activity is performed using Alternative Marketing Circuits (CIALCO), seeking to establish a direct relationship between producer and consumer prices, and promote buying and selling among family groups. The time-series forecasting, presented as a machine learning formulation, is enhanced with multi-variate predictions based on association rules extracted from transactions data analysis. These transactional data are used to learn the best association rules between products sold in different local markets, knowledge that allows the system to gain a significant improvement in forecasting accuracy by including these variables in multi-variate forecasting models. In the results we see that, from establishing best association rules valid in the original dataset, we can achieve a considerable improvement in prediction accuracy, validated with independent test subsequences of agricultural products using non-linear regression techniques including neural networks with a varying number of hidden layers. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Alternative circuits of commercialization; Association rules; Data mining; Predictive analysis; Time series; Trend of a series","Agricultural products; Agricultural robots; Association rules; Commerce; Forecasting; Information fusion; Multilayer neural networks; Statistical tests; Time series; Time series analysis; Turing machines; Agricultural markets; Forecasting accuracy; Forecasting models; Future consumption; Non-linear regression; Prediction accuracy; Time series forecasting; Transactional data; Data mining; article; consumer; data analysis; data mining; Ecuador; forecasting; human; marketing; prediction; time series analysis",,,,,"Abraham, T., Roddick, J.F., Incremental meta-mining from large temporal data sets.

To evaluate the effectiveness of spatial-temporal dependence forecasting, the basic time series forecasting models for use in our comparison were first built based on an autoregression integrated moving average model (ARIMA), a back-propagation neural network (BPNN), and support vector regression (SVR). Subsequently, combining a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) with SVR, an SVR- GBDT model for spatial-temporal dependence forecast was constructed. The SVR model was only used to build a spatial-temporal dependence forecasting model, which does not distinguish spatial and temporal information but instead takes them as data features. Taking inland ports in the Yangtze River as an example, the results indicated that the ports’ weekly freight volumes had a higher autocorrelation with the previous 1–3 weeks, and the Pearson correlation values of the ports’ weekly cargo volume were mainly located in the interval (0.2–0.5). In addition, the weekly freight volumes of the inland ports were higher depending on their past data, and the spatial-temporal dependence model improved the performance of the weekly freight volume forecasts for the inland river. This study may help to (1) reveal the significance of spatial correlation factors in ports’ short-term freight volume predictions, (2) develop prediction models for inland ports, and (3) improve the planning and operation of port entities. © 2021 by the authors.

Considering the lack of a mechanistic model that predicts daily feed intake in lactating sows, a novel approach combining an online forecasting procedure with an offline learning procedure is proposed. A database of 39,090 lactations, from 6 different farms and containing the first 20 daily feed intake records after farrowing, was used (1) to identify consistent sets of clusters and trajectory curves offline, and (2) to test 3 predictive functions of daily feed intake online. The homogeneity of the clusters resulting from the offline learning procedure was assessed according to Silhouette and Calinski-Harabasz scores. The predictive quality of forecasting functions was assessed with the Mean Error (ME), and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Time-series clustering with k-Shape makes it possible to extract consistent trajectory curves that are scale-, shift- and translate-invariant. The best number of clusters obtained either in a global approach or at farm scale was two. The trajectory curve of the first cluster is characterized by a mostly continuous increase of feed intake over the course of lactation, and the second cluster by a plateau in feed intake starting from about the 10th day of lactation. These identified trajectory curves are consistent with the very few studies available in the literature. When computed with the best forecasting function and farm specific trajectory curves, the ME of feed intake over lactation was −0.08 kg/d, and the corresponding RMSE was 1.06 kg/d. Though variability in feed intake among sows and over the lactation period is high, online forecasting of feed intake can be improved by the use of feed intake trajectory curves. These trajectory curves may be computed on a regular basis with data obtained directly on the farm or on farms with similar practices. The online forecasting procedure requires few computing resources, and could easily be embedded in smart feeder control systems as a practical application in precision feeding systems for lactating sows. © 2021 The Author(s)","Data Mining; Feed intake; k-Shape clustering; Lactating sow; Precision Livestock Farming; Time-series forecasting","Agriculture; Data mining; Embedded systems; Feeding; Mean square error; Online systems; Time series; Trajectories; Feed intake; Forecasting procedures; K-shape clustering; Lactating sow; Learning procedures; Off-line learning; Offline; Precision livestock farming; Time series clustering; Time series forecasting; Forecasting; cattle; cluster analysis; detection method; food intake; forecasting method; livestock farming; precision agriculture; strategic approach; time series analysis",,,,,"Aghabozorgi, S., Seyed Shirkhorshidi, A., Ying Wah, T., Time-series clustering – A decade review (2015) Information Systems, 53, pp. 16-38. , https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306437915000733, arXiv:1107.3326; Bagnall, A., Lines, J., Bostrom, A., Large, J., Keogh, E., The great time series classification bake off: a review and experimental evaluation of recent algorithmic advances (2017) Data Min.

Predicting electricity consumption data is a key factor for the energy sector in order to create a completely intelligent electricity grid that optimizes consumption and forecasts future energy needs. However, it is currently not enough to give a prediction of energy consumption (EC), but it is also necessary to give the prediction as fast as possible so that the grid can operate in the shortest possible time. An approach for developing EC prediction systems is introduced here by the use of artificial neural networks (ANN). Differently from other research studies on the subject, a divide-and-conquer strategy is used so that the target system’s execution switches from one to another specialized small models that forecast the EC of a building within the time range of one hour. By simultaneously processing a large amount of data and models, a consequence of implementing them in parallel with TensorFlow on GPUs, the training procedure proposed here increases the performance of the classic time series prediction methods, which are based on ANN. Leveraging the latest generation of ANN techniques and new GPU-based architectures, correct EC predictions can be obtained and, as the experimentation carried out in this work shows, such predictions can be obtained quickly. The obtained results in this study show a promising way for speeding up big data processing of building’s monitoring data to achieve energy efficiency. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore geospatial techniques could be integrated with mathematical models for accurate spatiotemporal mapping of groundwater risk areas at the village level. In the present study, changes in water level, quality patterns, and future trends were analyzed using eight years (2012–2019) groundwater data for 171 villages of the Phagi tehsil, Jaipur district. Kriging interpolation method was used to draw spatial maps for the pre-monsoon season. These datasets were integrated with three different time series forecasting models (Simple Exponential Smoothing, Holt's Trend Method, ARIMA) and Artificial Neural Network models for accurate prediction of groundwater level and quality parameters. Results reveal that the ANN model can describe groundwater level and quality parameters more accurately than the time series forecasting models. The change in groundwater level was observed with more than 4.0 m rise in 81 villages during 2012–2013, whereas ANN predicted results of 2023–2024 predict no rise in water level > 4.0 m. However, based on predicted results of 2024, the water level will drop by more than 6.0 m in 16 villages of Phagi. Assessment of water quality index reveals unfit groundwater in 74% villages for human consumption in 2024. This time series and projected groundwater level and quality at the micro-level can assist decision-makers in sustainable groundwater management. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","ARIMA; Artificial neural network; Geospatial; Groundwater; Water quality","Decision making; Deterioration; Drops; Forecasting; Groundwater; Interpolation; Neural networks; Potable water; Rural areas; Time series; Time series analysis; Water levels; Water management; Water quality; Artificial neural network models; Assessment of water qualities; Drinking and irrigations; Kriging interpolation methods; Simple exponential smoothing; Sustainable groundwater management; Time series forecasting models; Waterresource management; Groundwater resources; artificial neural network; computer simulation; decision making; drinking water; groundwater flow; irrigation; kriging; numerical model; prediction; semiarid region; spatial analysis; water management; water quality; water resource; India; Jaipur; Rajasthan",,,,,"Anastasiadisa, A.D., Magoulasa, G.D., Vrahatis, M.N., New globally convergent training scheme based on the resilient propagation algorithm (2005) Neurocomputing, 64, pp. 253-270; Annapoorna, H., Janardhana, M.R., Assessment of Groundwater Quality for Drinking Purpose in Rural Areas Surrounding a Defunct Copper Mine (2015) Aquat Procedia, 4, pp. 685-692; Asoka, A., Gleeson, T., Wada, Y., Mishra, V., Relative contribution of monsoon precipitation and pumping to changes in groundwater storage in India (2017) Nat Geosci, 10, pp. 109-117; Bărbulescu, A., Studies on Time Series Applications in Environmental Sciences (2016) Springer International Publishing, Cham, Switzerland; Bhunia, G.S., Keshavarzi, A., Shit, P.K., Omran, E.S.E., Bagherzadeh, A., Evaluation of groundwater quality and its suitability for drinking and irrigation using GIS and geostatistics techniques in semiarid region of Neyshabur (2018) Iran Appl Water Sci, 8, p. 168; Brown, R.G., (1956) Exponential Smoothing for Predicting Demand, p. 15. , Arthur D.

Moreover, due to variable satellite coverage and bursty traffic, the network load of S-IoT changes dynamically; therefore, when existing random access schemes are applied directly to the S-IoT environment, the actual throughput is far below the theoretical maximum. Accordingly, this paper proposes an intelligent load control-based random access scheme based on CRDSA++, which is an enhanced version of the contention resolution diversity slotted ALOHA (CRDSA) and extends the CRDSA concept to more than two replicas. The proposed scheme is dubbed load control-based three-replica contention resolution diversity slotted ALOHA (LC-CRDSA3). LC-CRDSA3 actively controls network load. When the load threatens to exceed the critical value, only certain nodes are allowed to send data, and the load is controlled to be near the critical value, thereby effectively improving the throughput. In order to accurately carry out load con-trol, we innovatively propose a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)-based load estimation algo-rithm, which estimates the load value of each received frame by making full use of the number of time slots in different states. On this basis, LC-CRDSA3 adopts computational intelligence-based time series forecasting technology to predict the load values of future frames using the historical load values. We evaluated the performance of LC-CRDSA3 through a series of simulation experiments and compared it with CRDSA++. Our experimental results demonstrate that in S-IoT contexts where the load changes dynamically, LC-CRDSA3 can obtain network throughput that is close to the theoretical maximum across a wide load range through accurate load control. © 2021 by the authors.

To know the QoE, providers today typically predict it from the Quality of Service (QoS) parameters or the client-side's actual QoE metrics measured at the current time-step. But the former does not precisely reflect the users' experience, and the latter has a delay between QoE measurements at the client-side and the user's current experience. Mitigating this delay can provide a noticeable improvement in the delivery system's performance. For example, accurate forecasting of QoE for the near future allows the service management system to take a proactive approach and fix delivery issues before they become a noticeable problem at the end user, or at least reduce overall QoE degradation. QoE forecasting can also be used in rate adaptation in DASH or resource allocation in wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a method to prognosticate QoE metrics. Using data collected from an industry video streaming testbed for three different classes, we define a multivariate time series forecasting problem. We then model a hybrid state-of-the-art deep learning method, BiLSTM-CNN, to forecast the QoE metrics in advance. Evaluation of our proposed method compared to four other well-known ML models of Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Long short-term memory (LSTM), and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) demonstrates the superior performance of our proposed method. © 2020 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; forecasting; machine learning algorithms; multimedia communication; quality management; recurrent neural networks; streaming media; time series analysis","Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Long short-term memory; Media streaming; Multimedia systems; Quality control; Time series analysis; Video conferencing; Video on demand; 'current; Client sides; End-users; Machine learning algorithms; Multi-media communications; Multivariate time series; Networked video; Streaming medium; Time-series analysis; Video quality; Quality of service",,,,,"(2021) Cisco Visual Networking Index: Forecast and Trends, 2017-2022, , www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/serviceprovider/visual-networking-index-vni/white-paper-c11-741490.html, Cisco, Feb. 27, 2019.

To overcome these shortcomings, this paper builds trend fuzzy granulation based long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to carry out long-term forecasting, where data points with consistent trend characteristics including trend change, fluctuation range and trend persistence are predicted in unison rather than individually. Noticing that these trend characteristics are more urgently needed than just magnitude information, a question on how to granulate a time series into a granular time series consists of meaningful granules containing trend information comes to be a crucial step. Only if the established granules fit the varying patterns of time series at utmost can such granulation make sense for the improvement of the forecasting accuracy, thus an optimization method of trend-oriented fuzzy granulation is proposed to meliorate the granulation results. With the built trend fuzzy granulation based LSTM networks, the successive iterations of one-step forecasting are prevented, and the prediction errors of data within a granule will not further increase. This is the first attempt to build trend fuzzy granule based LSTM to predict trend characteristics. Experiments completed on publicly available time series show good performance of the proposed model.

In addition, highly accurate sea level forecasts allow adequate water management policies and coastal infrastructures to be developed.

In this study, a novel approach based on Copula functions is presented for the prediction of sea level anomalies. The primary purpose of this study is to examine the applicability and capability of Copula-based prediction models in predicting short-term variations in the sea level. The minimum 95% correlations and minimum 22 mm RMSE values in sea level anomaly predictions during the testing period indicate that the Copula approach can be a powerful tool in the prediction of sea level anomalies. © 2020 Survey Review Ltd.","Black Sea; Copula; Prediction; Sea level anomaly; Sea level rise; Time series forecasting","coastal zone management; conservation; correlation; environmental modeling; environmental planning; numerical method; prediction; sea level change; time series analysis; Black Sea",,,,,"Akaike, H., A new look at the statistical model identification (1974) IEEE transactions on automatic control, 19 (6), pp. 716-723; Aloui, R., Hammoudeh, S., Nguyen, D.K., A time-varying copula approach to oil and stock market dependence: the case of transition economies (2013) Energy economics, 39, pp. 208-221; Arya, F.K., Zhang, L., Copula-based markov process for forecasting and analyzing risk of water quality time series (2017) Journal of hydrologic engineering, 22 (6); Bárdossy, A., Li, J., Geostatistical interpolation using copulas (2008) Water resources research, 44 (7). , W07412; Brundrit, G., Trends of southern african sea level: statistical analysis and interpretation (1995) South African journal of marine science, 16 (1), pp. 9-17; Etcheverry, L.R., A comparison of the annual cycle of sea level in coastal areas from gridded satellite altimetry and tide gauges (2015) Continental shelf research, 92, pp. 87-97. , et al; Fu, Y., Hybrid model combining empirical mode decomposition, singular spectrum analysis, and least squares for satellite-derived sea-level anomaly prediction (2019) International journal of remote sensing, 40 (20), pp. 7817-7829. , et al; Ghorbani, M.A., Sea water level forecasting using genetic programming and comparing the performance with artificial neural networks (2010) Computers & geosciences, 36 (5), pp. 620-627. , et al; Gómez-Enri, J., Modeling envisat ra-2 waveforms in the coastal zone: case study of calm water contamination (2010) IEEE geoscience and remote sensing letters, 7 (3), pp. 474-478. , et al; Gülöksüz, Ç.T., Comparison of some selection criteria for selecting bivariate archimedean copulas (2016) Afyon kocatepe üniversitesi fen ve mühendislik bilimleri dergisi, 16 (2), pp. 250-255; Imani, M., Daily sea level prediction at chiayi coast, taiwan using extreme learning machine and relevance vector machine (2018) Global and planetary change, 161, pp. 211-221. , et al; Imani, M., You, R.J., Kuo, C.-Y., Accurate forecasting of the satellite-derived seasonal caspian sea level anomaly using polynomial interpolation and holt-winters exponential smoothing (2013) Tao: terrestrial, atmospheric and oceanic sciences, 24 (4), p. 521; Imani, M., You, R.J., Kuo, C.Y., Analysis and prediction of caspian sea level pattern anomalies observed by satellite altimetry using autoregressive integrated moving average models (2014) Arabian journal of geosciences, 7 (8), pp. 3339-3348; Imani, M., You, R.J., Kuo, C.Y., Caspian sea level prediction using satellite altimetry by artificial neural networks (2014) International journal of environmental science and technology, 11 (4), pp. 1035-1042; Imani, M., You, R.J., Kuo, C.Y., Forecasting caspian sea level changes using satellite altimetry data (June 1992–December 2013) based on evolutionary support vector regression algorithms and gene expression programming (2014) Global and planetary change, 121, pp. 53-63; Irvine, K., Eberhardt, A., Multiplicative, seasonal ARIMA models for lake Erie and lake Ontario water levels (1992) Journal of the American water resources association, 28 (2), pp. 385-396; Joe, H., (1997) Multivariate models and multivariate dependence concepts, , London, England: CRC Press; Joe, H., Xu, J.J., (1996), The estimation method of inference functions for margins for multivariate models.

As the data sampling frequency increases, the functional characteristics of data become more obvious. Based on the functional principal component analysis, the functional principal component score was predicted by BM, OLS, RR, PLS, and other methods, and the dynamic forecasting curve was reconstructed by the predicted value. The traditional forecasting methods mainly focus on point prediction, while the functional time series forecasting method can avoid the point forecasting limitation, and realize line prediction and dynamic forecasting, which is superior to the traditional analysis method. In this paper, the empirical analysis uses the 5-minute closing price data of the stock index futures contract (IF1812). The results show that the BM prediction method performed the best. In this paper, data are considered as a functional time series analysis object, and the interference caused by overnight information is removed so that it can better explore the intraday volatility law, which is conducive to further understanding of market microstructure. © 2020 Fuji Technology Press.

The relative demand for renewable energy compared to traditional energy is an important index to determine the energy supply structure. Forecasting the relative demand index has become quite essential. Data mining methods like decision trees are quite effective in such time series forecasting, but theory behind them is rarely discussed in research. In this paper, some theories are explored about decision trees including the behavior of bias, variance, and squared prediction error using trees and the prediction interval analysis. After that, real UK grid data are used in interval forecasting application. In the renewable energy ratio forecasting application, the ratio of renewable energy supply over that of traditional energy can be dynamically forecasted with an interval coverage accuracy higher than 80% and a small width around 22, which is similar to its standard deviation. © 2020 Xin Zhao and Xiaokai Nie.",,"Data mining;

Then, the system establishes the equilibrium trading price when all prosumers execute their optimal actions simultaneously.

The objective of this article is to compare these methods and provide readers with an idea of what method(s) to apply to solve their forecasting needs. The Artificial Intelligence-based techniques included in the comparison are Nearest Neighbors (the original method, and a version tuned by Differential Evolution), Fuzzy Forecasting, Artificial Neural Networks (designed and tuned by Genetic Algorithms), and Genetic Programming. These techniques were tested against twenty wind speed time series, obtained from Russian and Mexican weather stations, predicting the wind speed for 10 days, one day at a time. The results show that Nearest Neighbors using Differential Evolution outperforms the other methods. An idea this article delivers to the reader is: what part of the history of the time series to use as input to a forecaster? This question is answered by the reconstruction of phase space. Reconstruction methods approximate the phase space from the available data, yielding m (the system’s dimension) and τ (the sub-sampling constant), which can be used to determine the input for the different forecasting methods. © 2019 by the authors.","Machine learning; Time series forecasting; Wind speed forecasting","Forecasting; Fuzzy neural networks; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Learning systems; Object oriented programming; Soft computing; Speed; Time series; Time series analysis; Wind; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Differential Evolution; Performance comparison; Phase space reconstruction; Reconstruction of phase spaces; Soft computing methods; Time series forecasting; Wind speed forecasting; Phase space methods",,,,,"How pollution is threatening our world (2014) World Economic Forum, , https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2014/11/pollution-top-concern-2015/, Available online: accessed on 26 December 2017; Wang, X., Guo, P., Huang, X., A review of wind power forecasting models (2011) Energy Procedia, 12, pp. 770-778; Calif, R., Schmitt, F.G., Huang, Y., Multifractal description of wind power fluctuations using arbitrary order Hilbert spectral analysis (2013) Phys.

There is no theoretical limitation to grey prediction models to adapt to almost every process by taking the appropriate order. However, deficiencies of traditional higher-order models have made researchers overlook flexibility and make use of first-order models by default. In order to bridge the mentioned gap, this paper makes two contributions. First, a novel discrete modeling is developed with the basic-form equation, reconciling estimation and prediction processes. Second, the traditional least-squares estimation technique is modified by shifting the focus from nominal parameters to parameters practically employed in the prediction process. The new approach named 'Basic Form'-focused Grey Model (BFGM) is applied to first-order, second-order, and Verhulst grey models. Then, it is validated through comparing its performance with the traditional approach's. Results show that, in most cases, BFGM makes considerable improvements in simulation and prediction accuracy, while it has reasonable computational complexity. Improvements are particularly dramatic when BFGM is applied to GM (2, 1). The resultant BFGM (2, 1) is superior in simulation and short-term prediction and, therefore, can be regarded as the basis for developing efficient higher-order grey formulations. © 2018 Sharif University of Technology.

A minor improvement in the predictive ability of water inflows time series might lead both to: (i) lower costs to final consumers; and (ii) higher power reliability. This paper explores Periodic Gamma Autoregressive Models (PGAR) to model brazilian water inflows time series. This type of time series has some features which seem to be more adaptable to Gamma models, like nonnegative random values and asymmetric pattern. The main purpose of this study is to compare periodic Normal and Lognormal models to PGAR. The results suggest that: (i) both Gamma and Lognormal models perform better than Normal model; and (ii) the Gamma model is a good alternative to the Lognormal model. © 2017 EDP Sciences, ROADEF, SMAI.","Periodic gamma autoregressive models; Time series analysis; Water resources management","Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Water resources; Asymmetric patterns; Auto regressive models; Brazilian Power Systems; Hydroelectric systems; Hydrological time-series; Power reliability; Predictive abilities; Water resources management; Time series analysis",,,,,"Akaike, H., A new look at the statistical model identification (1974) IEEE Trans.

Recurrent neural networks, particularly gated recurrent units and long short-term memory, have been the state-of-the-art traffic flow forecasting models for the last few years. However, a more sophisticated and resilient model is necessary to effectively acquire long-range correlations in the time-series data sequence under analysis. The dominant performance of transformers by overcoming the drawbacks of recurrent neural networks in natural language processing might tackle this need and lead to successful time-series forecasting. This article presents a multi-head attention based transformer model for traffic flow forecasting with a comparative analysis between a gated recurrent unit and a long-short term memory-based model on PeMS dataset in this context. The model uses 5 heads with 5 identical layers of encoder and decoder and relies on Square Subsequent Masking techniques. The results demonstrate the promising performance of the transform-based model in predicting long-term traffic flow patterns effectively after feeding it with substantial amount of data. It also demonstrates its worthiness by increasing the mean squared errors and mean absolute percentage errors by (1.25−47.8)% and (32.4−83.8)%, respectively, concerning the current baselines. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Deep learning; Gated recurrent unit; Intelligent transportation system; Long short-term memory; PeMS; Time-series forecasting","Brain; Forecasting; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Learning algorithms; Mean square error; Natural language processing systems; Street traffic control; Time series; Time series analysis; Traffic congestion; Comparative analyzes; Deep learning; Gated recurrent unit; Intelligent transportation systems; PeMS; Performance; State of the art; Time series forecasting; Traffic flow forecasting; Transformer modeling; Long short-term memory",,,,,"Awad, M., Khanna, R., Support vector regression (2015) Efficient learning machines, pp. 67-80. , Springer; Bartlett, Z., Han, L., Nguyen, T., Johnson, P., Prediction of road traffic flow based on deep recurrent neural networks (2019), pp. 102-109; Baum, C., KPSS: STata module to compute Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin test for stationarity (2018); Chen, C., Freeway performance measurement system (PeMS) (2002), University of California Berkeley; Cholakov, R., Kolev, T., Transformers predicting the future.

The paper proposes a novel multiple alternative clustering time series analysis based hierarchical electricity time series prediction method. Instead of adhering the aggregation consistency passively, we first exploit time series mining to construct a hierarchy, and then apply an optimal reconciliation method to improve the prediction accuracy. In particular, k-means clustering method is employed to cluster time series for many times with different k so as to make a large number of time series clusters (patterns), and then the clusters (patterns) based hierarchies are constructed respectively. With the large number of clusters hierarchies and the original geographical hierarchy, an optimal aggregation consistency reconciliation based prediction approach is proposed. Furthermore, the sparse penalty is adapted in our method for “ideal” clusters selection to improve the prediction performance. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods on real-life datasets, our method achieves the improvement of 11.13% and 24.07% accurate one-step ahead forecasts on electricity load and solar power data respectively. © 2022","Data mining; Hierarchical time series forecasting; Machine learning","Cluster analysis; Data mining; Decision making; Forecasting; K-means clustering; Solar energy; Time series analysis; Alternative clustering; Big data applications; Cluster patterns; Clustering time series; Decisions makings; Hierarchical time series forecasting; Time series forecasting; Time series prediction; Time-series analysis; Times series; Machine learning",,,,,"Kremer, M., Siemsen, E., Thomas, D.J., The sum and its parts: judgmental hierarchical forecasting (2015) Manage.

Therefore, it is important to forecast future cumulative confirmed cases to plan and implement control measures effectively. Methods: This study proposed a hybrid autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and Prophet model to predict daily confirmed and cumulative confirmed cases. The built-in auto.arima function was first used to select the optimal hyperparameter values of the ARIMA model. Then, the modified ARIMA model was used to find the best fit between the test and forecast data to find the best model parameter combinations. Articles, blog posts, and news stories from virologists, scientists, and health experts related to the third wave of COVID-19 were gathered using the Python web scraping package Beautiful Soup. Their opinions (sentiments) toward the potential third wave were analyzed using natural language processing (NLP) libraries. Results: A spike in daily confirmed and cumulative confirmed cases was predicted in India in the next 180 days based on past time series data. The results were validated using various analytical tools and evaluation metrics, producing a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.14 and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.06. The NLP processing results revealed negative sentiments in most articles and blogs, with few exceptions. Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that there will be more active cases in the upcoming days. The proposed models can forecast future daily confirmed and cumulative confirmed cases. This study will help the country and states plan appropriate public health measures for the upcoming waves of COVID-19. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","ARIMA; COVID-19; Natural language processing; Prophet; Sentiment analysis; Time series forecasting","Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Mean square error; Public health; Sentiment analysis; Time series; Time series analysis; Auto-regressive; Autoregressive integrated moving average; COVID-19; Machine learning models; Moving average model; Moving averages; Prophet; Sentiment analysis; Statistical machine learning; Time series forecasting; Forecasting; moclobemide; accuracy; adult; Article; autoregressive integrated moving average; coronavirus disease 2019; forecasting; groups by age; human; independent variable; India; machine learning; natural language processing; pandemic; polynomial regression analysis; predictive model; root mean squared error; seasonal variation; sentiment analysis; social media; susceptible exposed infectious recovered model; time series analysis; virologist",,"moclobemide, 71320-77-9",,,"WHO Announces COVID-19 Outbreak a Pandemic (2020), https://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/healthemergencies/coronavirus-COVID-19/news/news/2020/3/who-announcesCOVID-19-outbreak-a-pandemic, Available from:; Meares, H.D., Jones, M.P., When a system breaks: queueing theory model of intensive care bed needs during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020) Med.

Recent studies have shown the superiority of Transformer in dealing with such problems, especially long sequence time series input (LSTI) and long sequence time series forecasting (LSTF) problems. To improve the efficiency and enhance the locality of Transformer, these studies combine Transformer with CNN in varying degrees. However, their combinations are loosely-coupled and do not make full use of CNN. To address this issue, we propose the concept of tightly-coupled convolutional Transformer (TCCT) and three TCCT architectures which apply transformed CNN architectures into Transformer: (1) CSPAttention: through fusing CSPNet with self-attention mechanism, the computation cost of self-attention mechanism is reduced by 30% and the memory usage is reduced by 50% while achieving equivalent or beyond prediction accuracy. (2) Dilated causal convolution: this method is to modify the distilling operation proposed by Informer through replacing canonical convolutional layers with dilated causal convolutional layers to gain exponentially receptive field growth. (3) Passthrough mechanism: the application of passthrough mechanism to stack of self-attention blocks helps Transformer-like models get more fine-grained information with negligible extra computation costs. Our experiments on real-world datasets show that our TCCT architectures could greatly improve the performance of existing state-of-the-art Transformer models on time series forecasting with much lower computation and memory costs, including canonical Transformer, LogTrans and Informer. © 2022 The Author(s)","CNN; Time series forecasting; Transformer","Forecasting; Memory architecture; Time series; Attention mechanisms; CNN; Computation costs; Input sequence; Long sequences; Real-world; Tightly-coupled; Time series forecasting; Times series; Transformer; Convolution; article; attention; convolutional neural network; forecasting; memory; prediction; receptive field; time series analysis",,,,,"Kim, K.J., Financial time series forecasting using support vector machines (2003) Neurocomputing, 55 (1-2), pp. 307-319; Bashar, M., (2021), Event-driven timeseries analysis and the comparison of public reactions on COVID-19 arXiv preprint arXiv:2104.14777; Michau, G., Fink, O., (2021), Fully Learnable Deep Wavelet Transform for Unsupervised Monitoring of High-Frequency Time Series arXiv preprint arXiv:2105.00899; Garnot, V.S.F., Landrieu, L., (2020) Lightweight Temporal Self-Attention for Classifying Satellite Images Time Series, pp. 171-181. , Springer Cham; Box, G.E., Jenkins, G.M., Some recent advances in forecasting and control (1968) J.

More specifically, the emphasis is on the long-term implications of distributed energy resources on energy loss and how it affects the electricity market. The proposed methodology is based on a modified combination of the Bass diffusion model (time-series forecasting of the penetration level of distributed energy resources) and the optimized tariff model (socioeconomic regulated electricity market model). Such models have not previously been applied jointly, even though they exhibit great potential for long-term market assessment in the context of distributed energy resources integration. The methodology enables the analysis of multiple public policies regarding renewable distributed generation and energy storage systems, such as net billing schemes to accelerate their deployment. Furthermore, the methodology also enables the assessment of energy storage systems' feasibility. By applying the methodology to a concession area in southern Brazil, results demonstrate that energy storage systems are feasible if combined with appropriate public policies, as a performance index (mean socioeconomic gain) of 329 (MR$) was obtained. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bass diffusion model; energy loss; energy storage systems; public policies; renewable distributed generation; socioeconomic electricity market model","Diffusion; Distributed power generation; Electric energy storage; Electric industry; Power markets; Time series; Time series analysis; Bass Diffusion Model; Distributed energies; Distributed Energy Resources; Electricity market modelling; Energy storage system; Penetration level; Renewable distributed generations; Socio-economics; Socioeconomic electricity market model; Storage systems; Public policy",,,,,"Goldie-Scot, L., (2019), https://about.bnef.com/blog/behind-scenes-take-lithium-ion-battery-prices/(accessed, A Behind the Scenes Take on Lithium-ion Battery Prices.

The difficulty in the study of ocean wave forecasting is that ocean waves have non-linear and non-stationary characteristics. The Auto-Regressive (AR) model is widely used in time series forecasting, but it is weak in processing non-linearity and non-stationarity. The Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model developed for timing problems has strong non-linear processing capabilities, but there are shortcomings in the treatment of non-stationarity. Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) can effectively separate non-linearity and non-stationarity in data. This paper combines the advantages of the LSTM model and EMD and proposes an EMD-LSTM method. Based on significant wave heights from three locations offshore China, it has been found that the error of the EMD-LSTM method is lower than that of the LSTM model. Meanwhile, it has been found that the EMD-LSTM method can increase the forecast time in advance by more than doubled under the same tolerance by analyzing the forecast effect of different forecast times. It has been proved that the EMD-LSTM model has good superiority for the prediction of non-linear and non-stationary waves. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","EMD-LSTM method; Empirical mode decomposition (EMD); LSTM model; Non-linear and non-stationary; Wave forecast","Forecasting; Oceanography; Offshore oil well production; Signal processing; Water waves; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Empirical mode decomposition-long short term memory method; Long short term memory model; Memory modeling; Non linear; Non-linear and non-stationary; Nonstationary; Wave forecast; Long short-term memory; artificial neural network; nonlinearity; prediction; regression analysis; standing wave; time series analysis; China",,,,,"Agrawal, J.D., Deo, M.C., On-line wave prediction (2002) Mar.

Time series forecasting can be examined through single step ahead as well as multi-step ahead forecasting despite its proven complex analysis and trends preserving limitations. Auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) is a widely accepted model for time series prediction. In this paper, we proposed a hyperparameter selection strategy for the ARIMA model using fusion of differential evolution (DE) and artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm. Modified algorithms retain the exploration and exploitation strategies with the union of evolutionary algorithms with stock market time series data. The modified ABC using DE Optimization induces better generalization and efficient performance as compared to existing ARIMA models. In this paper, experiments are performed over 10 years of the dataset of Oil Drilling and Exploration and Refineries sector of National Stock Exchange and Bombay Stock Exchange from September 1, 2010 to August 31, 2020. Obtained result demonstrates that the proposed strategy using modified ABC-ARIMA hybrid model has superior performance than its counterparts. Proposed strategy achieves improved performance in forecasting accuracy along with preserving data trends in multi-step time series forecasting. © 2021, Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management.","ABC and DE; ARIMA; Time series",,,,,,"Box, G.E., Jenkins, G.M., Reinsel, G.C., Ljung, G.M., (2015) Time series analysis: forecasting and control, , Wiley, New York; Pai, P.F., Lin, C.S., A hybrid ARIMA and support vector machines model in stock price forecasting (2005) Omega, 33 (6), pp. 497-505; Babu, C.N., Reddy, B.E., Prediction of selected Indian stock using a partitioning—interpolation based ARIMA–GARCH model (2015) Appl Comput Inform, 11 (2), pp. 130-143; Domingos, S.D.O., de Oliveira, J.F., de Mattos Neto, P.S., An intelligent hybridization of ARIMA with machine learning models for time series forecasting (2019) Knowl Based Syst, 175, pp. 72-86; Khashei, M., Bijari, M., An artificial neural network (p, d, q) model for time series forecasting (2010) Expert Syst Appl, 37 (1), pp. 479-489; Khashei, M., Bijari, M., A novel hybridization of artificial neural networks and ARIMA models for time series forecasting (2011) Appl Soft Comput, 11 (2), pp. 2664-2675; Zhou, K., Wang, W.Y., Hu, T., Wu, C.H., Comparison of time series forecasting based on statistical ARIMA model and LSTM with attention mechanism (2020) J Phys Conf Ser, 1631 (1), p. 012141; Vantuch, T., Zelinka, I., Evolutionary based ARIMA models for stock price forecasting (2015) ISCS 2014: Interdisciplinary Symposium on Complex Systems, pp. 239-247. , In:, Springer, Cham; Musdholifah, A., Sari, A.K., Optimization of ARIMA forecasting model using firefly algorithm (2019) Indones J Comput Cybern Syst, 13 (2), pp. 127-136; Kumar, R., Kumar, P., Kumar, Y., Integrating big data driven sentiments polarity and ABC-optimized LSTM for time series forecasting (2021) Multimed Tools Appl, , (,),.,., https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-021-11029-1; Kumar, R., Kumar, P., Kumar, Y., Analysis of financial time series forecasting using deep learning model (2021) 2021 11Th International Conference on Cloud Computing, Data Science & Engineering (Confluence), pp. 877-881. , In:,.

Paulo Malschitzki 200 (Zona Industrial Norte) SC, Joinville, Brazil","Contamination in insulators results in an increase in surface conductivity. With higher surface conductivity, insulators are more vulnerable to discharges that can damage them, thus reducing the reliability of the electrical system. One of the indications that the insulator is losing its insulating properties is its increase in leakage current. By varying the leakage current over time, it is possible to determine whether the insulator will develop an irreversible failure. In this way, by predicting the increase in leakage current, it is possible to carry out maintenance to avoid system failures. For forecasting time series, there are many models that have been studied and the definition of which model is suitable for evaluation depends on the characteristics of the data associated with the analysis. Thus, this work aims to identify the most suitable model to predict the increase in leakage current in relation to the time the insulator is outdoors, exposed to environmental variations using the same database to compare the methods. In this paper, the models based on linear regression, support vector regression (SVR), multilayer Perceptron (MLP), deep neural network (DNN), and recurrent neural network (RNN) will be analyzed comparatively. The best accuracy results for prediction were found using the RNN models, resulting in an accuracy of up to 97.25%. © 2022 - IOS Press.

MVA initially maps time series data into a complex network using the visibility graph method. Then, based on the similarity measures between the nodes in the network, MVA calculates the one-step-ahead forecasts. MVA does not use all past terms in the forecasting process, but only the most significant observations, which are indicated as a result of the autocorrelation function. This method was applied to five different groups of data, most of them showing trend characteristics, seasonal variations and/or non-stationary behavior. We calculated error measures to evaluate the performance of MVA. The results of statistical tests and error measures revealed that MVA has a good performance compared to the accuracy obtained by the benchmarks considered in this work. In all cases, MVA surpassed other forecasting methods in Literature, which confirms that this work will contribute to the field of time series forecasting not only in the theoretical aspect, but also in practice.

This paper introduces a new three-stage approach for time series forecasting based on quartile data that combines aggregation, prototype selection and forecasting in the Symbolic Data Analysis (SDA) framework. Initially, time series are summarized and classes of entities are obtained by representing new time series. A prototype selection process based on mutual information is applied in order to obtain a more representative class data set. Each class is described by a list of three continues values, called quartile symbolic data. Boxplots time series are displayed, as a special case. In this framework, symbolic data are obtained to take into account variability between the entities of the classes. Approaches for boxplots forecasting are constructed from multivariate statistical modeling. Synthetic and real symbolic time series are considered in the experiments to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Boxplots; Multiple time series; Mutual information; Prototype selection; Symbolic data analysis; Vector autoregressive models","Data handling; Forecasting; Information analysis; Multivariant analysis; Time series analysis; Analysis frameworks; Boxplot; Multiple time series; Mutual informations; Prototype selection; Symbolic data; Symbolic data analysis; Time series forecasting; Times series; Vector autoregressive model; Time series",,,,,"Akaike, H., A new look at the statistical model identification (1974) IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 19 (6), pp. 716-723; Arroyo, J., Gonzalez-Rivera, G., Maté, C., Forecasting with interval and histogram data: some financial applications (2011) Handbook of Empirical Economics and Finance, pp. 247-279; Arroyo, J., Maté, C., Forecasting histogram time series with k-nearest neighbours methods (2009) International Journal of Forecasting, 25 (1), pp. 192-207; Arroyo, J., Maté, C., noz San Roque, A.M., Hierarchical clustering for boxplot variables (2006) Data science and classification, pp. 59-66. , Batagelj V.

In this context, Fuzzy Time Series has been standing out due to its capacity of using mathematical functions to represent linguistic variables, resulting in interpretative and more accurate models. Several studies aim at improving time series forecasting using fuzzy set theory, however such efforts were executed solely to obtain modeling improvements in the fuzzification stage, disregarding the stochastic and deterministic influences composing time series to assist the modeling process. In an attempt to fill out such gap, this manuscript employs the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) to extract the deterministic influences which are next modeled using fuzzy clustering to improve time series forecasting. EMD reduces the data imprecision and uncertainty thus helping the fuzzy clustering stage that automatically finds an adequate space partitioning to produce the fuzzy sets. We use Fuzzy C-means to generate fuzzy sets with different characteristics, contributing to improvements in the definition of the number of sets, usually barely explored in the fuzzification stage. Our method was assessed using different validation indices while forecasting time series, which has confirmed promising results and supported the interpretability of data ranges along time. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Decomposition; Fuzzy clustering; Time series fuzzification","Forecasting; Functions; Fuzzy set theory; Signal processing; Stochastic systems; Time series; Time series analysis; Analysis models; Deterministic component; Deterministics; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Fuzzifications; Time series forecasting; Time series fuzzification; Time-series analysis; Times series; Uncertainty; Fuzzy clustering",,,,,"Box, G.E.P., Jenkins, G., Time Series Analysis, Forecasting and Control (1990), Holden-Day, Inc.

Inspired by the incremental construction strategy for building a random multilayer perceptron, we propose a novel Error-feedback Stochastic Modeling (ESM) strategy to construct a random Convolutional Neural Network (ESM-CNN) for time series forecasting task, which builds the network architecture adaptively. The ESM strategy suggests that random filters and neurons of the error-feedback fully connected layer are incrementally added to steadily compensate the prediction error during the construction process, and then a filter selection strategy is introduced to enable ESM-CNN to extract the different size of temporal features, providing helpful information at each iterative process for the prediction. The performance of ESM-CNN is justified on its prediction accuracy of one-step-ahead and multi-step-ahead forecasting tasks respectively. Comprehensive experiments on both the synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed ESM-CNN not only outperforms the state-of-art random neural networks, but also exhibits stronger predictive power and less computing overhead in comparison to trained state-of-art deep neural network models. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Convolutional neural network; Error-feedback stochastic modeling; Time series forecasting","Arts computing; Convolution; Deep neural networks; Errors; Multilayer neural networks; Network architecture; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Time series; Convolutional neural network; Error feedback; Error-feedback stochastic modeling; Hyper-parameter; Modeling and forecasting; Modelling strategies; Neural network architecture; Stochastic-modeling; Time series forecasting; Times series models; Forecasting; accuracy; algorithm; Article; artificial neural network; binocular convergence; computer model; convolutional neural network; Error feedback Stochastic Modeling; evaluation study; forecasting; human; machine learning; mathematical model; multilayer perceptron; perceptron; prediction; support vector machine; time series analysis; training",,,,,"Sezer, O.B., Ozbayoglu, A.M., Algorithmic financial trading with deep convolutional neural networks: Time series to image conversion approach (2018) Applied Soft Computing, 70, pp. 525-538; Cavalli, S., Amoretti, M., CNN-based multivariate data analysis for bitcoin trend prediction (2021) Applied Soft Computing, 101; Luo, Z., Cai, X., Tanaka, K., Takiguchi, T., Kinkyo, T., Hamori, S., Can we forecast daily oil futures prices?

The calculation can be performed at various intervals: after a minute, an hour, a day, a week, a month, or a year, depending on how much detail the process should be analyzed. In time series analysis problems, we deal with discrete-time, when each observation of a parameter forms a time frame. The same can be said about the behavior of Covid-19 over time. In this paper, we solve the problem of predicting Covid-19 diseases in the world using neural networks. This approach is useful when it is necessary to overcome difficulties related to non-stationarity, incompleteness, unknown distribution of data, or when statistical methods are not completely satisfactory. The problem of forecasting is solved with the help of the analytical platform Deductor Studio, developed by specialists of the company Intersoft Lab of the Russian Federation. When solving this problem, appropriate methods were used to clean the data from noise and anomalies, which ensured the quality of building a predictive model and obtaining forecast values for tens of days ahead. The principle of time series forecasting was also demonstrated: import, seasonal detection, cleaning, smoothing, building a predictive model, and predicting Covid-19 diseases in the world using neural technologies for 30 days ahead. © 2021, Allerton Press, Inc.","coronavirus pandemics; data preprocessing; forecasting; neural networks; time series; training and control samples","Forecasting; Time series analysis; Control samples; Coronavirus pandemic; Coronaviruses; Data preprocessing; Day-ahead; Neural-networks; Predictive models; Time-series analysis; Times series; Training sample; Coronavirus",,,,,"Judy, Y.J.L., Guo, S., Xia, L., Xu, G., Multi-projection of unequal dimension optimal transport theory for Generative Adversary Networks (2020) Neural Networks, 128, pp. 107-125; Shi, Y., Liu, J., Wang, B., Qi, Z., Tian, Y.J., Deep learning from label proportions with labeled samples (2020) Neural Networks, 128, pp. 73-81; Rahman, M.A., Hossain, M.S., Alrajeh, N.A., Guizani, N., B5G and explainable deep learning assisted healthcare vertical at the edge: COVID-I9 perspective (2020) IEEE Network, 34, pp. 98-105; Zhao, A., Balakrishnan, G., Durand, F., Data augmentation using learned transformations for one-shot medical image segmentation (2019) In Proc. of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 43-53; Szegedy, C., Liu, W., Jia, Y., Sermanet, P., Reed, S., Anguelov, D., Going deeper with convolutions (2015) In Proc. of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Patternrecognition, pp. 1-9; Chudzik, P., Majumdar, S., Caliva, F., Al-Diri, B., Hunter, A., (2018) Exudate segmentation using fully convolutional neural networks and inception modules, Medical Imaging 2018: Image Processing, 10574; Zhang, R., Zheng, Y., Poon, C.C., Shen, D., Lau, J.Y., Polyp detection during colonoscopy using a regression-based convolutional neural network with a tracker (2018) Pattern Recognit., 83, pp. 209-219; (2016) IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 770-778; Hadsell, R., Chopra, S., I’Cun, Y., Dimensionality reduction by learning an invariant mapping (2006) Proc. of 2006 IEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'06), pp. 1735-1742. , New York, NY, USA; Chollet, F., Xception: Deep learning with depthwise separable convolutions (2017) Proc. of 2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR, pp. 1800-1807; Hossain, M.S., Muhammad, G., Guizani, N., Explainable AI and mass surveillance system-based healthcare framework to combat COVID-I9 like pandemics (2020) IEEE Network, 34, pp. 126-132; Dongsucher, D., Li, R., Li, L.J.K., ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database (2009) Proc. of 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR, pp. 248-255. , pp; Quaternion-valued recurrent projection neural networks on unit quaternions (2020) Theor.

Hence appropriate demand side forecasting has a great economical worth. Objective of our paper is to render representations of a suitable time series forecasting model using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and Holt Winters model for the energy consumption of Ohio/Kentucky and also predict the accuracy considering different periods (daily, weekly, monthly). We apply these two models and observe that Holt Winters model outperforms ARIMA model in each (daily, weekly and monthly observations) of the cases. We also make a comparison among few other existing analyses of time series forecasting and find out that the mean absolute percentage error (MASE) of Holt Winters model is least considering the monthly data. © 2021.

An APM software accomplishes the main goals through automation, measurements, analysis and diagnostics. Gartner specifies the three crucial capabilities of APM softwares. The first is an end-user experience monitoring for revealing the interactions of users with application and infrastructure components. The second is application discovery, diagnostics and tracing. The third key component is machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) powered data analytics for predictions, anomaly detection, event correlations and root cause analysis. Time series metrics, logs and traces are the three pillars of observability and the valuable source of information for IT operations. Accurate, scalable and robust time series forecasting and anomaly detection are the requested capabilities of the analytics. Approaches based on neural networks (NN) and deep learning gain an increasing popularity due to their flexibility and ability to tackle complex nonlinear problems. However, some of the disadvantages of NN-based models for distributed cloud applications mitigate expectations and require specific approaches. We demonstrate how NN-models, pretrained on a global time series database, can be applied to customer specific data using transfer learning. In general, NN-models adequately operate only on stationary time series. Application to nonstationary time series requires multilayer data processing including hypothesis testing for data categorization, category specific transformations into stationary data, forecasting and backward transformations. We present the mathematical background of this approach and discuss experimental results based on implementation for Wavefront by VMware (an APM software) while monitoring real customer cloud environments. © 2021 by the authors.

Based on a number of methods, including methods of graphical analysis, time series forecasting, construction of linear trends, correlation analysis and scenario forecasting, the authors stated the fact of the serious depth of the problem of innovative insufficiency in the oil sector in comparison with other sectors and they built six scenarios for the development of these companies. The applied methods made it possible to not only come to the conclusion that with the current level of investment in R&D in the oil and gas sector, Oil Companies may find themselves in difficult conditions, especially if breakthrough technologies show themselves in the non-hydrocarbon energy of the future, but also made it possible to determine the most important directions for the development of Oil Companies, including the formation and development of the oil and gas industry 4.0, marketing strategic management of the activities of these companies. © 2021 by the authors.

Recent researches focus towards network embedding to improve the performance of link prediction task. Most of the network embedding methods are only applicable to static networks and therefore cannot capture the temporal variations of dynamic networks. In this work, we propose a time-aware network embedding method which generates node embeddings by capturing the temporal dynamics of evolving networks. Unlike existing works which use deep architectures, we design an evolving skip-gram architecture to create dynamic node embeddings. We use the node embedding similarities between consecutive snapshots to construct a univariate time series of node similarities. Further, we use times series forecasting using auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to predict the future links. We conduct experiments using dynamic network snapshot datasets from various domains and demonstrate the advantages of our system compared to other state-of-the-art methods. We show that, combining network embedding with time series forecasting methods can be an efficient solution to improve the quality of link prediction in dynamic networks. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Dynamic networks;

It is one of the critical challenges to extract the intrinsic information for estimating future trends from historical data. Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) shows excellent performance in this assignment. Probabilistic information extraction, which is demonstrated effective in object recognition in recent years, has not been introduced in time series prediction. To our knowledge, there has not been any work on plugging trainable probability distributions into LSTM as feature representation in an end-to-end manner. In this work we put forward an Adaptive Log-Euclidean Gaussian embedding Network (ALGeNet) to take one step further on solving this problem. The core of the network is capturing statistical information through the Gaussian Distribution with LSTM for end-to-end learning. As the space of Gaussian Distribution is a manifold, we try to embed Gaussian layer into LSTM through mapping Gaussian space into a linear space based on the Lie group and logarithm operation. We introduce four descriptors of Gaussian, two descriptors performing direct logarithm and the others performing indirect logarithm. All of them can extract first-order and second-order statistical features while utilizing the structures of geometry and smooth group of Gaussians. Furthermore, our adaptive mechanism merges the advantages of each descriptor and works well. Experimental results on a real-world wind speed dataset and a system-level electricity load dataset show that the proposed adaptive network outperforms some state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptive learning; Lie group; Log-Euclidean; LSTM; Time series forecasting; Uncertainty modeling","Embeddings; Forecasting; Gaussian distribution; Lie groups; Object recognition; Time series; Wind; Feature representation; Logarithm operations; Probabilistic information; State-of-the-art algorithms; Statistical features; Statistical information; Time series forecasting; Time series prediction; Long short-term memory; algorithm; article; electricity; embedding; extraction; forecasting; geometry; learning; long short term memory network; prediction; probability; recognition; time series analysis; uncertainty; wind speed",,,,,"Arnelid, H., Zec, E.L., Mohammadiha, N., Recurrent conditional generative adversarial networks for autonomous driving sensor modelling (2019) 2019 IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC), IEEE, pp. 1613-1618; Arsigny, V., Fillard, P., Pennec, X., Ayache, N., Fast and simple calculus on tensors in the log-euclidean framework (2005) International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention, Springer, pp. 115-122; Bo, R., Li, F., Probabilistic lmp forecasting considering load uncertainty (2009) IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 24, pp. 1279-1289. , https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2009.2023268, URL:; Brechtel, S., Gindele, T., Dillmann, R., Probabilistic decision-making under uncertainty for autonomous driving using continuous pomdps (2014) 17th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC), IEEE, pp. 392-399. , https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957722, URL:; Calvo, M., Oller, J.M., A distance between multivariate normal distributions based in an embedding into the siegel group (1990) Journal of Multivariate Analysis, 35, pp. 223-242. , https://doi.org/10.1016/0047-259X(90)90026-E, URL:; Chandra, R., Zhang, M., Cooperative coevolution of elman recurrent neural networks for chaotic time series prediction (2012) Neurocomputing, 86, pp. 116-123. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2012.01.014, URL:; Der Kiureghian, A., Ditlevsen, O., Aleatory or epistemic? does it matter?

This study presents the use of machine learning techniques for projecting COVID-19 infections and deaths in Mexico. The research has three main objectives: first, to identify which function adjusts the best to the infected population growth in Mexico; second, to determine the feature importance of climate and mobility; third, to compare the results of a traditional time series statistical model with a modern approach in machine learning. The motivation for this work is to support health care providers in their preparation and planning. The methods compared are linear, polynomial, and generalized logistic regression models to describe the growth of COVID-19 incidents in Mexico. Additionally, machine learning and time series techniques are used to identify feature importance and perform forecasting for daily cases and fatalities. The study uses the publicly available data sets from the John Hopkins University of Medicine in conjunction with the mobility rates obtained from Google’s Mobility Reports and climate variables acquired from the Weather Online API. The results suggest that the logistic growth model fits best the pandemic’s behavior, that there is enough correlation of climate and mobility variables with the disease numbers, and that the Long short-term memory network can be exploited for predicting daily cases. Given this, we propose a model to predict daily cases and fatalities for SARS-CoV-2 using time series data, mobility, and weather variables. © 2021, The Author(s).","Covid19; Data science; Recurrent neural networks; Time series forecasting","Climate models; Diseases; Forecasting; Logistic regression; Population statistics; Recurrent neural networks; Time series; Time series analysis; Health care providers; John Hopkins University; Logistic growth model; Logistic regression models; Machine learning techniques; Statistical modeling; Time series models; Time series techniques; Learning systems",,,,,"(2020) Pneumonia of Unknown Cause China.

FTS models can handle data sets with a small number of observations or with uncertainty. This is a general advantage of FTS as compared with other techniques. However, FTS models still have some criticisms, such as the optimal lengths of intervals and the proper weights, which always influence the model accuracy and still have been of many concerns in literature. The work in this paper proposes a novel FTS forecasting model based on a new tree partitioning method (TPM) and Markov chain (MC), called FTSMC-TPM, for determining the optimal partitions of intervals and the proper weights vectors respectively, and this will greatly improve the model accuracy. The efficiency of the FTSMC-TPM model is tested using two types of time series consisting of the air pollution index (API) data, which is collected from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and the benchmark data of the yearly enrollments for the University of Alabama. Three statistical criteria have been used for investigating the accuracy of the proposed model. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms the existing classic and advanced time series models in terms of forecasting accuracy. In addition, the proposed model shows the ability to successfully deal with forecasting problems to obtain higher model accuracy, which is examined in comparison with the existing models to validate its superiority. Hence, this study demonstrates that the proposed model is more suitable for the accurate prediction of air pollution events as well as for forecasting any type of random time series. © 2013 IEEE.","Air pollution; fuzzy logical relation; fuzzy time series; Kuala Lumpur; Markov chain; tree partition method","Air pollution; Forecasting; Markov chains; Stochastic systems; Time series; Time series analysis; Air pollution index; Forecasting accuracy; Forecasting modeling; Forecasting problems; Fuzzy time series (FTS); Statistical criterion; Time series forecasting; University of Alabama; Stochastic models",,,,,"Yusuf, S., Mohammad, A., Hamisu, A.A., A novel two-Factor high order fuzzy time series with applications to temperature and futures exchange forecasting (2017) Nigerian J.

However, no real-life application of soil gas monitoring has been developed until now. We present a new monitoring approach that is based on a continuous comparison of actual soil CO2 concentration data against predicted target values including estimated confidence intervals which are considered as threshold values. Our new approach is based on time series forecasting methods. Since they are not commonplace in soil gas monitoring we give an introduction to simple approaches and more sophisticated modelling categories. These have been tested on different data sets from our soil gas monitoring data base. Finally, we apply the most robust overall model to real time monitoring data of the Hontomín carbon sequestration pilot site. The evaluation revealed that Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models give reliable estimates of future soil gas concentrations. On a practice-relevant time frame, the accuracy of predicted values and confidence intervals is better than compared to simple approaches like seasonal means. As a result, we present a practical, methodological approach that increases the technology readiness level of soil gas monitoring. Moreover, it has a high potential to be transferred to other environmental monitoring compartments (e.g. soil gas emissions). Since the applied workflow can be automated, integration in real time monitoring systems is straightforward. However, a minimum of two years of data is required to achieve an adequate forecasting precision. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","forecasting; real-time; soil CO2 threshold assessment; Soil gas monitoring","Autoregressive moving average model; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Digital storage; Forecasting; Gas detectors; Gas emissions; Real time systems; Soil pollution; Soils; Time series analysis; Auto regressive integrated moving average models; Environmental Monitoring; Methodological approach; Real time monitoring system; Real-life applications; Soil gas concentration; Technology readiness levels; Time series forecasting; Monitoring; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; environmental monitoring; forecasting method; real time; soil carbon",,,,,"Alm, J., Shurpali, N.J., Minkkinen, K., Aro, L., Hytöne, J., Laurila, T., Lohila, A., Laine, J., Emission factors and their uncertainty for the exchange of CO2, CH4 and N2O in Finnish managed peatlands (2007) Boreal Environ.

In this Study, forecasting is done with the help Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM-NN) models on the basis of the historical data of rice cultivation from the year 1950-51 to 2017-18. The well fitted ARIMA models for the parameters such as Area under Cultivation (0,1,1), Production (0,1,1) and Yielding (2,2,1) are obtained from the significant spikes of their respective Auto Correlation Function (ACF) and Partial Auto Correlation Function (PACF) plots. But, the models fitted with a supervised deep learning neural network known as LSTM-NN are found much better time series forecasting model than the ARIMA models. The performances of these models validated with the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values. From the study, the LSTM-NN’s are more flexible and able to develop accurate models for predicting the behavior of agricultural parameters than the ARIMA models. © 2019 Kiran Kumar Paidipati and Arjun Banik licensed to EAI.

In order to attain the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for MMR in India, the purpose of this research work is to identify the trends in the essential components, which are responsible for maternal death prevention. Methods: To achieve the above-mentioned objective we have evaluated the performance of three different approaches in our process model for Time Series Predictive Modelling on public maternal health data. The first approach is Exponential Smoothing method i.e. is a statistics based method, the second one is Multi Layer Perceptron method i.e. a machine learning based method and the third one is Long Short Term Memory network i.e. a deep learning method. For the data analysis, the five years’ monthly time series data (2012 to 2017) of Uttar Pradesh state of India is collected from NRHM portal of Indian Government. It is partitioned into training data for modeling and testing data for validation of the model. Results: The major components from the original data are selected by using an attribute selection method i.e. greedy approach based Best-First Wrapper method. The MAPE statistical parameter is used to define the accuracy level of the predictive values for the selected dimensions of the given data. A performance-based comparison of all applied approaches is presented at last which illustrates that exponential smoothing method has performed better than the other two methods. Conclusion: The presented trend analysis and future values generated by using the presented process model will feed input in the decision making for planning better healthcare services. © Bentham Science Publishers.

It is crucial for nations to develop and enhance student and teacher potential to increase national competitiveness. The decreasing population of children has caused a series of social problems in many developed countries, directly affecting education and com.petitiveness in an international environment. In Taiwan, a low birthrate has had a large impact on schools at every level because of a substantial decrease in enrollment and a surplus of teachers. Therefore, close attention must be paid to these trends. In this study, combining a whale optimization algorithm (WOA) and support vector regression (WOASVR) was proposed to determine trends of student and teacher numbers in Taiwan for higher accuracy in time-series forecasting analysis. To select the most suitable support vector kernel parameters, WOA was applied. Data collected from the Ministry of Education datasets of student and teacher numbers between 1991 and 2018 were used to examine the proposed method. Analysis revealed that the numbers of students and teachers decreased annually except in private primary schools. A comparison of the forecasting results obtained from WOASVR and other common models indicated that WOASVR provided the lowest mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE) for all analyzed datasets. Forecasting performed using the WOASVR method can provide accurate data for use in developing education policies and responses. © 2020 Stephanie Yang et al.",,"Competition; Education computing; Forecasting;

Many robotic systems, such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), are required to operate in environments with disturbances and relative motion that make task performance difficult. This motion often exhibits periodic, near-sinusoidal behaviour. By predicting this motion, control strategies can be developed to improve accuracy. Moreover, factoring in uncertainty can aid the robustness of these predictive control methods. Time series and Fourier series have been applied to several predictive control problems in a variety of fields. However, there are contradictory results in performance based on parameters, assessment criteria, and application. This paper seeks to clarify these discrepancies using AUV motion as a case study. GPR is also introduced as a third candidate for prediction based on previous applications to time series forecasting in other fields of science. In addition to assessing mean prediction accuracy, the ability of each model to adequately bound prediction error is also considered as a key performance indicator. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","AUV; Motion; Prediction; Robot; Wave","Benchmarking; Forecasting; Fourier series; Motion estimation; Robots; Time series; Waves; Assessment criteria; Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs); Gaussian process regression; Key performance indicators; Motion; Predictive control methods; Time series forecasting; Underwater vehicles; Autonomous underwater vehicles; accuracy assessment; bathymetry; Fourier transform; Gaussian method; numerical model; prediction; robotics; ship motion; time series analysis; underwater vehicle",,,,,"Becker, B., Tummala, H., Riviere, C., (2008), pp. 1948-1951. , Autoregressive modeling of physiological tremor under microsurgical conditions.

It is based on modeling the error of the base propagator to be enhanced. Both statistical time-series forecasting methods and machine-learning techniques can be used for that purpose. The standard procedure for developing a hybrid orbit propagator requires some initial control data, that is, a set of precise ephemerides corresponding to either real observations or accurately computed pseudo-observations, from which to model the base-propagator error dynamics. It also needs tuning the time-series forecaster from those control data. We propose an improvement to the hybrid methodology for orbit propagation, based on fitting new hybrid propagators from others previously developed for nearby initial conditions, which avoids the need for both the control data and the tuning process, and achieves comparable results. © 2019","Artificial satellite theory; Generalized additive models; Holt-Winters; Hybrid propagation methodology; Orbit propagator; Time series forecasting","Earth (planet); Forecasting; Orbits; Space debris; Time series; Generalized additive model; Holt-Winters; Hybrid propagation methodology; Orbit propagators; Time series forecasting; Learning systems; article; forecasting; machine learning; time series analysis; winter",,,,,"Kinoshita, H., Nakai, H., Numerical integration methods in dynamical Astronomy (1989) Celest.

To deal with noise and concept of non-linear pattern in series data, we propose hybrid prediction model based on linear combination method to perform the ensemble of backpropagation neural networks (BPNN), support vector regression (SVR), and integrated auto-regressive moving average (ARIMA) individual predictors in this paper. Equal, inverse MSE, variance-covariance (VACO), and rank methods are used to estimate weight for participating predictors. Experiments on actual datasets Euro/Sudanese pound exchange rate demonstrate the performance of the hybrid algorithm in terms of prediction accuracy, weight estimation, and combination efficiency. The prediction accuracy is further improved by combining the base predictors based on their linear weights. The results indicate that the proposed hybrid models based on VACO yield better accuracy results compared to the best individual predictors and other hybrid models. Though, the linear method can be utilized as optimal combining methods to achieve more significant forecasting accuracy. © 2018, International Association of Engineers.

The comprehensive evaluation model has been constructed. Then, the time series forecasting model, the gray forecasting model and the Bayesian forecasting model selected by comprehensive evaluation model should build the mathematical model through variation coefficient method.

With more than eight lakh death count within a very short span of seven months, this deadly virus has affected more than 24 million people across 213 countries and territories around the world. Time-series analysis, modeling, and forecasting are important research areas that explore the hidden insights from larger set of time-bound data for arriving at better decisions. In this work, data analysis on COVID-19 dataset is performed by comparing the top six populated countries in the world. The data used for the evaluation is taken for a time period from 22nd January 2020 to 23rd August 2020. A novel time-series forecasting approach based on auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model is also proposed.

The main goal is to take advantage of their inherent properties to generate fast, highly accurate forecasts. To this end, the key modeling decisions involved in forecasting with generalized regression neural networks are described. To deal with every modeling decision, several strategies are proposed. Each strategy is analyzed in terms of forecast accuracy and computational time. Apart from the modeling decisions, any successful time series forecasting methodology has to be able to capture the seasonal and trend patterns found in a time series. In this regard, some clever techniques to cope with these patterns are also suggested. The proposed methodology is able to forecast time series in an automatic way. Additionally, the paper introduces a publicly available R package that incorporates the best presented modeling approaches and transformations to forecast time series with generalized regression neural networks. © 2021 The Author(s)","Generalized regression neural networks; Software; Time series forecasting","Forecasting; Neural networks; Regression analysis; Forecast time; Generalized regression; Generalized regression neural network; Highly accurate; Modeling decisions; Property; Regression neural networks; Software; Time series forecasting; Times series; Time series; article; forecasting; generalized regression neural network; software; time series analysis",,,,,"Kim, K., Financial time series forecasting using support vector machines (2003) Neurocomputing, 55 (1), pp. 307-319; Dudek, G., Neural networks for pattern-based short-term load forecasting: A comparative study (2016) Neurocomputing, 205, pp. 64-74; Araújo, R., Oliveira, A., Meira, S., On the problem of forecasting air pollutant concentration with morphological models (2017) Neurocomputing, 265, pp. 91-104; Box, G.E.P., Jenkins, G.M., Reinsel, G.C., Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control (2008), 4th Edition John Wiley & Sons Hoboken; Montero-Manso, P., Athanasopoulos, G., Hyndman, R.J., Talagala, T.S., FFORMA: Feature-based forecast model averaging (2020) International Journal of Forecasting, 36 (1), pp. 86-92; Specht, D.F., A general regression neural network (1991) Trans.

They proposed a no-learning method, named Convolution Nuclear Norm Minimization (CNNM), and proved that CNNM can exactly recover the future part of a series from its observed part, provided that the series is convolutionally low-rank. While impressive, the convolutional low-rankness condition may not be satisfied whenever the series is far from being seasonal, and is in fact brittle to the presence of trends and dynamics. This paper tries to approach the issues by integrating a learnable, orthonormal transformation into CNNM, with the purpose for converting the series of involute structures into regular signals of convolutionally low-rank. We prove that the resultant model, termed Learning-Based CNNM (LbCNNM), strictly succeeds in identifying the future part of a series, as long as the transform of the series is convolutionally low-rank. To learn proper transformations that may meet the required success conditions, we devise an interpretable method based on Principal Component Pursuit (PCP). Equipped with this learning method and some elaborate data argumentation skills, LbCNNM not only can handle well the major components of time series (including trends, seasonality and dynamics), but also can make use of the forecasts provided by some other forecasting methods; this means LbCNNM can be used as a general tool for model combination. Extensive experiments on 100,452 real-world time series from Time Series Data Library (TSDL) and M4 Competition (M4) demonstrate the superior performance of LbCNNM. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","coherence; Compressed sensing; dictionary learning; Fourier transform; model combination; sparsity and low-rankness; time series forecasting","Compressed sensing; Convolution; Forecasting; Learning systems; Market Research; Principal component analysis; Time series analysis; Compressed-Sensing; Dictionary learning; Low rankness; Market researches; Model combination; Predictive models; Sparse matrices; Sparsity and low-rankness; Time series forecasting; Time-series analysis; Discrete Fourier transforms",,,,,"Liu, G., Zhang, W., (2019) Recovery of Future Data Via Convolution Nuclear Norm Minimization; Montero-Manso, P., Hyndman, R.J., Principles and algorithms for forecasting groups of time series: Locality and globality (2021) Int.

However, due to the explosive growth of sensing data, traditional time series analysis approaches fail in handling large-scale data with missing values. To this end, two autoregressive (AR) based matrix factorization (MF) methods are presented for missing sensor data imputation and structural response forecasting. The first model integrates the standard MF formulation with an innovative graph-based temporal regularizer, which can effectively model the nonlinear dynamics of SHM data and is computationally efficient, while the second approach introduces an additional AR-based matrix to better simulate the temporal factor thanks to its capability of learning the details of temporal evolution. Finally, the proposed methods are evaluated by using a field-recorded SHM dataset of a municipal concrete bridge, considering various missing scenarios (i.e., random, structured and mixed). The results demonstrate excellent performance of the methods which accurately recover missing entries in the time series and forecast future response. Additionally, the parametric analysis on model parameters indicates that reasonably higher rank and longer time lag improve the estimation accuracy while saving computational cost. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Autoregressive; Data imputation; Matrix factorization; Spatiotemporal; Structural health monitoring; Time series forecasting","Data handling; Forecasting; Graphic methods; Matrix algebra; Matrix factorization; Time series analysis; Auto-regressive; Civil engineering applications; Data imputation; Matrix factorizations; Monitoring time; Spatiotemporal; Structural monitoring; Time series forecasting; Time-series data; Times series; Structural health monitoring",,,,,"Kalman, R.E., A new approach to linear filtering and prediction problems (1960); West, M., Harrison, J., Bayesian Forecasting and Dynamic Models (2006), Springer Science & Business Media; Lu, D., Fan, X., BayesIan forecasting of structural bending capacity of aging bridges based on dynamic linear model (2012) Life-Cycle and Sustainability of Civil Infrastructure Systems: Proceedings of the Third International Symposium on Life-Cycle Civil Engineering (IALCCE’12), Vienna, Austria, October 3-6, 2012, p. 98. , CRC Press; Xue-Ping, F., Da-gang, L., BayesIan prediction of structural bearing capacity of aging bridges based on dynamic linear model (2012) J.

To overcome the above challenges, we propose a multi-source and multivariate ozone prediction model based on fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) and evidential reasoning theory from the perspective of spatio-temporal fusion, termed as ERC-FCM. In this framework, an FCM-based prediction model is introduced to solve the ozone forecasting problem. Inspired by the multivariate time series forecasting, a multivariate ozone prediction problem is modeled as an FCM learned by the real-coded genetic algorithm, in which each node denotes a variable (pollutant). Thus, both the complex evolution trend of ozone and the cross-interference phenomena can be reflected by the FCM. Further, we propose an ensemble theoretical framework based on evidence reasoning theory and the matrix 2 norm. This theoretical framework relieves the negative factors from the low-quality monitoring data and improves the prediction accuracy when facing multi-source and multivariate time series. The performance of ERC-FCM is validated on two real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method yields the best prediction performance by comparison with the other classical FCM-based methods on mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), and root mean square error (RMSE). In addition, the Friedman test and Nemenyi test show that ERC-FCM gets relatively better prediction accuracy than other models. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Ensemble learning; Evidential reasoning theory; Fuzzy cognitive map; Ozone prediction; Time series analysis","Errors; Forecasting; Fuzzy Cognitive Maps; Fuzzy rules; Mean square error; Pollution control; Quality control; Time series analysis; Cognitive maps; Complex evolutions; Ensemble learning; Evidential reasoning; Evidential reasoning theory; Fuzzy cognitive map; Multi-Sources; Ozone prediction; Reasoning theory; Time-series analysis; Genetic algorithms",,,,,"Evans, M., Ozone mystery laid to rest (2019) Nature, 570 (7760), pp. 167-168; Palmer, J., The pollution detectives (2020) Nature, 577 (7791), pp. 464-466; Kumar, M., Shee, J., Rudshteyn, B., Reichman, D.R., Friesner, R.A., Miller, C.E., Francisco, J.S., Multiple stable isoprene – ozone complexes reveal complex entrance channel dynamics in the isoprene + ozone reaction (2020) J.

However, existing global–local approaches treat the global factors as additional hidden states inside the model without providing global series for downstream analysis. In this study, we propose DeepGate, a novel time series forecasting framework based on the explicit global–local decomposition. To retain the global and local series property, we have built decomposition and prediction modules separately. In this way, DeepGate can produce interpretable global series for further tasks while improving forecasting performance with the aid of global and local series. In addition, to alleviate the discrepancy between the training and testing steps, we employ a denoising training technique for multi-step forecasting problems. In numerous experiments on real-world benchmarks for time series forecasting, DeepGate outperforms the baselines including existing global–local models. In particular, the experimental results on synthetic tasks demonstrate that our model can effectively extract underlying global series. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Global-local decomposition; Interpretable neural networks; Multi-step forecasting; Multivariate time series; Time series analysis","Forecasting; Forecasting performance; Global factors; Global-local; Global-local decomposition; Interpretable neural network; Multi-step forecasting; Multivariate time series; Neural-networks; Time series forecasting; Time-series analysis; Time series analysis",,,,,"Seeger, M., Salinas, D., Flunkert, V., Bayesian intermittent demand forecasting for large inventories (2016) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems; Kim, K.-J., Financial time series forecasting using support vector machines (2003) Neurocomputing, 55 (1-2), pp. 307-319; Wu, Y., Lobato, J.M.H., Ghahramani, Z., Dynamic covariance models for multivariate financial time series (2013) 30th International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML 2013; Pang, Y., Yao, B., Zhou, X., Zhang, Y., Xu, Y., Tan, Z., Hierarchical electricity time series forecasting for integrating consumption patterns analysis and aggregation consistency (2018) IJCAI International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence; Lv, Y., Duan, Y., Kang, W., Li, Z., Wang, F.Y., Traffic Flow Prediction with Big Data: A Deep Learning Approach (2015) IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 16; Box, G.E.P., Jenkins, G.M., Reinsel, G.C., Ljung, G.M., Time series analysis: forecasting and control (2015), John Wiley & Sons; Cleveland, R.B., Cleveland, W.S., McRae, J.E., Terpenning, I., STL: A Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Procedure Based on Loess (with Discussion) (1990) Journal of Official Statistics, 6; (2016), A. van den Oord, S.

Different time series require different effective techniques to have better estimates for those missing values. Traditionally, the missing values are simply replaced by mean and mode imputation, deleted or handled using other methods, which are not convenient enough to address missing values, as those methods can cause bias. One of the most popular models used in estimating time-series data is autoregressive models. Autoregressive models forecast the future values in terms of the previous ones. The first-order autoregressive AR (1) model is the one which the current value is based on the immediately preceding value, then estimating parameters of AR (1) with missing observations is an urgent topic in time series analysis. Many approaches have been developed to address the estimation problems in time series such as ordinary least square (OLS), Yule Walker (YW). Therefore, a suggested method will be introduced to estimate the parameter of the model by using weighted least squares. The properties of the (WLS) estimator are investigated. Moreover, a comparison between those methods using AR (1) model with missing observations is conducted through a Monte Carlo simulation at various sample sizes and different proportions of missing observations, this comparison is conducted in terms of mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The results of the simulation study state that (WLS) estimator can be considered as the preferable method of estimation. Also, time series real data with missing observations were estimated. ©2022 by authors, all rights reserved.","AR(1) Model with Missing Observation; Estimation; Least Squares Estimator; Weighted Least Squares",,,,,,"Abdelwahab, M.

The frequency values of the harmonic content are used to define state variables in order to describe a signal through a time-varying linear state space model, which serves to synthesize an optimal state observer (Kalman-Bucy filter). Once the observer converges and the states (harmonics) become constant, the observer model can be used to predict the signal, i.e., a time series forecasting can be performed.The preocedure can be developed for the univariate or multivariate case of time series modeling, where in the last one, a statistical analysis is used to determine which variables should be taken into account to obtain a more accurate model. The proposed modeling approach is successfully applied for the modeling and forecast of the time series of electrical power demand and a wind/solar profile. © 2003-2012 IEEE.","Forecast; Fourier series; Kalman-Bucy filter; Optimal observer; Signal modeling; Time series","Bandpass filters; Fourier series; Harmonic analysis; Kalman filters; State space methods; Time series; Time series analysis; Fourier series analysis; Harmonic decomposition; Kalman-Bucy filter; Multivariate time series models; Optimal observers; Signal models; State space representation; Times series; Univariate; Univariate time series models; Forecasting",,,,,"Kirk, D.E., (2004) Optimal Control Theory, , An Introduction, 1st ed.

A single model applied on a data series may not obtain satisfactory prediction accuracy. Both theoretical and empirical findings have indicated that integration of linear model and nonlinear model may provide more accurate prediction than an individual linear or nonlinear model. This paper presents a hybrid modeling approach that combines a linear autoregressive (AR) model and a nonlinear deep belief network-based autoregressive (DBN-AR) model for time series forecasting. The proposed modeling approach first applies an AR model to fit time series data, and the error between the original date and the AR model forecast data as a nonlinear component is considered, and then the error is modeled by a DBN-AR model. DBaN-AR model is a modeling method for nonlinear time series, which uses a set of deep belief networks to approximate the state-dependent functional coefficients of state dependent auto-regressive model. The proposed hybrid model can overcome limitation of an individual model and obtain more general and more accurate forecasting result than some existing hybrid models. The experiment results demonstrate that the MSE of modeling residuals using the proposed hybrid model is largely reduced compared with the results of some single prediction models and some hybrid models for one-step-ahead and multistep-ahead forecast. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Deep belief network; Hybrid modeling method; Least square method; Time series forecasting","Bayesian networks; Decision making; Forecasting; Nonlinear systems; Time series; Time series analysis; Autoregressive modelling; Deep belief networks; Hybrid model; Hybrid modeling methods; Least-squares- methods; Linear modeling; Modeling approach; Network-based; Non-linear modelling; Time series forecasting; Least squares approximations",,,,,"Khashei, M., Bijari, M., A novel hybridization of artificial neural networks and ARIMA models for time series forecasting (2011) Appl Soft Comput, 11 (2), pp. 2664-2675; Khashei, M., Bijari, M., Ardali, G.A.R., Improvement of auto-regressive integrated moving average models using fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks (ANNs) (2009) Neurocomputing, 72 (4-6), pp. 956-967; Wang, D., Guo, H., Luo, H., Grunder, O., Lin, Y., Multi-step-ahead electricity price forecasting using a hybrid model based on two-layer decomposition technique and BP neural network optimized by firefly algorithm (2017) Appl Energy, 190, pp. 390-407; Lei, M., Luan, S., Jiang, C., Liu, H., Yan, Z., A review on the forecasting of wind speed and generated power (2009) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 13 (4), pp. 915-920; Shen, S., Shen, Y., ARIMA: an applied time series forecasting model for the bovespa stock index (2016) J Comput Commun, 5 (21), pp. 3383-3391; Takeda, H., Tamura, Y., Sato, S., Using the ensemble Kalman filter for electricity load forecasting and analysis (2016) Energy, 104, pp. 184-198; Bengio, Y., Learning deep architectures for AI (2009) Found Trends Mach Learn, 2 (1), pp. 1-127; Lv, Y., Duan, Y., Kang, W., Li, Z., Wang, F.Y., Traffic flow prediction with big data: a deep learning approach (2015) IEEE Trans Intell Transp Syst, 16 (2), pp. 865-873; Hinton, G.E., Osindero, S., Teh, Y.W., A fast learning algorithm for deep belief nets (2014) Neural Comput, 18 (7), pp. 1527-1554; Qin, M., Du, Z., Du, Z., Red tide time series forecasting by combining ARIMA and deep belief network (2017) Knowl-Based Syst, 125, pp. 39-52; Qiu, X., Ren, Y., Suganthan, P.N., Amaratunga, G.A.J., Empirical mode decomposition based ensemble deep learning for load demand time series forecasting (2017) Appl Soft Comput, 54, pp. 246-255; Yin, Y., Shang, P., Forecasting traffic time series with multivariate predicting method (2016) Appl Math Comput, 291, pp. 266-278; Shen, F., Chao, J., Zhao, J., Forecasting exchange rate using deep belief networks and conjugate gradient method (2015) Neurocomputing, 167, pp. 243-253; Dong, Y., Liu, Y., Lian, S., Automatic age estimation based on deep learning algorithm (2016) Neurocomputing, 187, pp. 4-10; Hinton, G.E., Salakhutdinov, R.R., Reducing the dimensionality of data with neural networks (2006) Science, 313 (5786), p. 504; Collobert, R., Weston, J., A unified architecture for natural language processing: Deep neural networks with multitask learning (2008) International Conference, pp. 160-167; Zhou, J., Jing, S., Gong, L., Fine tuning support vector machines for short-term wind speed forecasting (2011) Energy Convers Manag, 52 (4), pp. 1990-1998; Babu, C.N., Reddy, B.E., A moving-average filter based hybrid arima–ann model for forecasting time series data (2014) Appl Soft Comput, 23 (10), pp. 27-38; Li, S., Wang, P., Goel, L., A novel wavelet-based ensemble method for short-term load forecasting with hybrid neural networks and feature selection (2016) IEEE Trans Power Syst, 31 (3), pp. 1788-1798; Ardalani-Farsa, M., Zolfaghari, S., Chaotic time series prediction with residual analysis method using hybrid Elman-NARX neural networks (2010) Neurocomputing, 73 (13-15), pp. 2540-2553; Bai, Y., Chen, Z., Xie, J., Li, C., Daily reservoir inflow forecasting using multiscale deep feature learning with hybrid models (2016) J Hydrol, 532, pp. 193-206; Zhang, G.P., Time series forecasting using a hybrid ARIMA and neural network model (2003) Neurocomputing, 50 (1), pp. 159-175; Priestley, M.B., State-dependent models: a general approach to non-linear time series analysis (1980) J Time, 1 (1), pp. 47-71; Vesin, J., (1993) An Amplitude-Dependent Autoregressive Signal Model Based on a Radial Basis Functions Expansion.

Using the historical price series of Bitcoin and gold from 9/11/2016 to 9/10/2021, we investigate an LSTM-P neural network model for predicting the values of Bitcoin and gold in this research. We first employ a noise reduction approach based on the wavelet transform to smooth the fluctuations of the price data, which has been shown to increase the accuracy of subsequent predictions. Second, we apply a wavelet transform to diminish the influence of high-frequency noise components on prices. Third, in the price prediction model, we develop an optimized LSTM prediction model (LSPM-P) and train it using historical price data for gold and Bitcoin to make accurate predictions. As a consequence of our model, we have a high degree of accuracy when projecting future pricing. In addition, our LSTM-P model outperforms both the conventional LSTM models and other time series forecasting models in terms of accuracy and precision.

It also designs fuzzy-macro long short-term memory (LSTM), a variant of LSTM recurrent neural networks, which can predict drivers&#x2019; dangerous driving behaviors and risk degree. We elucidate how a macroscopic fuzzy inference dangerous driving behavior system is designed based on various driving behavior factors and the neuron architecture of the fuzzy-macro LSTM network. We collect real driving behavior data of drivers on the road and conduct a series of experimental analyses. Compared with five other commonly used time-series forecasting neural network models, our fuzzy-macro LSTM model performs best in terms of prediction error. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method for macroanalysis and prediction of dangerous driving behavior.

In order to overcome this shortcoming, this paper proposes a trend-fuzzy-granulation-based adaptive fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) for long-term time series forecasting. Different from the original FCM-based forecasting models, a class of trend fuzzy information granules is built to represent the trend, fluctuation range and trend persistence of various segments of time series, which are more instrumental and comprehensive than simple magnitude information. Thus, the proposed forecasting model is a granular model according to the form of its inputs and outputs. In an original FCM-based forecasting model, the causal relationships among concepts remain unchanged throughout the training of the whole dataset, however, in reality the causal relationships may change with the state of concepts. Therefore, it is unreasonable to use the invariable causal relationships which often result in poor predictions. In view of this, we construct an adaptive FCM where different causal relationships are built to forecast concepts of different states. This is the first time to forecast trend fuzzy information granules using an adaptive FCM. Compared with the existing classical forecasting models, the proposed forecasting model achieves superior performance which is verified through a series of experimental studies.

The inbound containers forecasting is essential for planning, scheduling, and resources allocation. The proposed framework consists of three main phases. First, the inbound historical transaction has been processed to find out the training window size (lags) using auto correlation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF). Second, the framework uses convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) as training networks for the historical time series data in two techniques. The proposed framework uses univariate and multivariate time series analysis to explore the maximum forecasting outcomes. Last, the framework measures the accuracy and compares the forecasting output using mean absolute error matrix (MAE) for both approaches. The experiments illustrated that RNN forecasts univariate inbound transaction with total 5.0954 MAE rather than 5.0236 for CNN. The CNN outperforms multivariate inbound containers forecasting with 0.7978 MAE. All the results has been compared with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and support vector machine (SVR). © 2022.

One of the significant issues that affect the performance of the forecasting model is the variability present in the components of the time series. The conventional forecasting techniques reduce the nonlinearity by eliminating its non-stationary components. However, improvements in results are often not significant. This paper proposes a wind speed forecasting approach capable of handling the variability present in wind time series components. In this approach, first, nonlinearity in wind time series is eliminated using trend-based clustering, and then statistical methods are applied to develop the forecasting models. The classical time-series data clustering techniques build a small number of clusters based on the distance metric for data values. As time-series data exhibits a serial correlation between subsequent observations, the distance metric cannot group similar data without affecting serial correlation. The proposed method presents novel time-series clustering techniques applied on wind data using triplet (Growing, Decline, and Identical) analysis of trend components to identify similar trend shapes. Once the clusters of identical trend shapes are generated, a cluster is selected based on the Pearson Correlation Coefficient. After that, statistical models (ARIMA, SARIMA, GAS) and the neural network-based model (LSTM) are applied to forecast the selected cluster. The proposed models have superior prediction accuracy than the existing forecasting model, as evidenced by the comparison result curve between actual and forecasted wind speed, the histogram of Friedman ANOVA mean ranks, and the performance measuring indices. The proposed models (C-ARIMA, C-GAS, C-SARIMA, and C-LSTM) enhance the performance of ARIMA, SARIMA, GAS, and LSTM models, and the percentage improvement is 39.66%, 24.16%, 21.02%, and 54.38%, respectively. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","ARIMA model;

We consider radar spectrum sharing in 5.6GHz where a weather radar operates as a primary system and the dominant secondary system is an enterprise network consisting of access points (APs) in a university campus. Our work models transmit the power of the APs as a time series with multinomial distribution based on real collected data. The aggregated interference due to the transmissions from the APs at the radar is forecasted using a long short-term memory (LSTM) based neural network. Monte Carlo dropout is utilized to generate prediction intervals that capture the uncertainties in the interference from the APs. Finally, by using both average and upper limits of predicted interference time series a cloud-assisted efficient sharing and radar protection algorithm is proposed. Tracking the rotating radar is not required in the proposed system. The results show that the proposed efficient sharing and radar protection system ensures better radar protection and increased throughput for wireless communication users. © 2013 IEEE.","Aggregated interference; DFS; LSTM; neural networks; radar; real network data; spectrum sharing; time series forecasting; WLAN","Long short-term memory; Meteorological radar; Radar interference; Radar signal processing; Tracking radar; Weather forecasting; Access points; Aggregated interference; DFS; Interference; Neural-networks; Real network datum; Spectrum sharing; Time series forecasting; Time-series analysis; Wireless communications; Time series analysis",,,,,"(2011) Report on Collective Use of Spectrum (CUS) and Other Spectrum Sharing Approaches, RSP Group, RSPG11-392, Radio Spectr.

However, a lack of model explainability makes it hard to properly interpret forecasting results for existing memristive LSTM networks, which makes this NCA unreliable, unaccountable and untrustworthy. In this paper, an interpretable memristive (IM) LSTM network design is proposed for time series forecasting, where the mixture attention technique is embedded into IM-LSTM cells for characterizing the variable-wise feature and the temporal importance. The updating rules and training approach are also presented for this interpretable memristive LSTM network. We evaluate this approach on a probabilistic residential load forecasting task incorporating PV. By improving model interpretability, the most influential predictive factors can be verified by Built Environment domain experts, demonstrating the effectiveness of our design.

Previous work mainly predicted exchange rates solely based on market indicators and therefore achieved unsatisfactory results. In response to such an issue, this study develops an inventive multimodal fusion-based long short-term memory (MF-LSTM) model to forecast the USD/CNY exchange rate. Our model consists of two parallel LSTM modules that extract abstract features from each modality of information and a shared representation layer that fuses these features. In terms of the text modality, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) is applied to conduct a sentiment analysis on social media microblogs. Compared to previous studies, we incorporate not only market indicators but also investor sentiments into consideration, treating the two types of data differently to match their exclusive characteristics. In addition, we apply the multimodal fusion technique and contrive a deep coupled model rather than a shallow and simple model to reflect the couplings between the two modalities. As a consequence, the experimental results obtained over a 15-month period exhibit the superiority of the proposed approach over nine baseline algorithms. The purpose of our study is to demonstrate that it is practicable and effective to incorporate multimodal fusion into financial time series forecasting. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Exchange rate forecasting; MF-LSTM; Multimodal fusion; Sentiment analysis","Abstracting; Commerce; Data mining; Forecasting; Investments; Long short-term memory; Time series analysis; Exchange rate forecasting; Exchange rates; Fusion model; Memory modeling; Multi-modal fusion; Multimodal fusion-based long short-term memory; Sentiment analysis; Shared representations; Social media; Sentiment analysis",,,,,"Fx and otc derivatives markets through the lens of the triennial survey (2019) BIS Quarterly Review; Cao, W., Zhu, W., Wang, W., Demazeau, Y., Zhang, C., A deep coupled lstm approach for usd/cny exchange rate forecasting (2020) IEEE Intell Syst, pp. 1-10. , https://doi.org/10.1109/MIS.2020.2977283; Kocenda, E., Moravcova, M., Intraday effect of news on emerging european forex markets: An event study analysis (2018) Econ Syst, 42 (4), pp. 597-615; Market efficiency, long-term returns, and behavioral finance (2021) University of Chicago Press, , https://doi.org/10.7208/9780226426983-009; Jiao, P., Veiga, A., Walther, A., Social media, news media and the stock market (2020) J Econ Behav Organ, 176, pp. 63-90; Shmilovici, A., Kahiri, Y., Ben-Gal, I., Hauser, S., Measuring the efficiency of the intraday forex market with a universal data compression algorithm (2009) Comput Econ, 33 (2), pp. 131-154; Barberis, N., Thaler, R., (2005) A Survey of Behavioral Finance, , https://doi.org/10.1515/9781400829125-004, Princeton University Press; Frank, M.Z., Sanati, A., How does the stock market absorb shocks?

We introduce a novel load forecasting method in which observed dynamics are modeled as a forced linear system using Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) in time delay coordinates. Central to this approach is the insight that grid load, like many observables on complex real-world systems, has an 'almost-periodic' character, i.e., a continuous Fourier spectrum punctuated by dominant peaks, which capture regular (e.g., daily or weekly) recurrences in the dynamics. The forecasting method presented takes advantage of this property by (i) regressing to a deterministic linear model whose eigenspectrum maps onto those peaks, and (ii) simultaneously learning a stochastic Gaussian process regression (GPR) process to actuate this system. Our forecasting algorithm is compared against state-of-the-art forecasting techniques not using additional explanatory variables and is shown to produce superior performance. We further show that this joint approach offers marked improvement over existing methods that use purely DMD or GPR. Moreover, its use of linear intrinsic dynamics offers a number of desirable properties in terms of interpretability and parsimony. Results are presented for a test case using load data from an electrical grid. Load forecasting is an essential challenge in power systems engineering, with major implications for real-time control, pricing, maintenance, and security decisions. © 2013 IEEE.","Data-driven forecasting; dynamic mode decomposition; Gaussian process regression; load forecasting; power grids","Electric power plant loads; Electric power system control; Electric power transmission networks; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Linear systems; Real time control; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Time series analysis; Data driven; Data-driven forecasting; Dynamic mode decompositions; Gaussian process regression; Load forecasting; Load modeling; Power system dynamics; Predictive models; Time-series analysis; Forecasting",,,,,"Box, G.E., Jenkins, G.M., Reinsel, G.C., (2011) Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control, 734. , Hoboken, NJ, USA: Wiley; Das, S., (1994) Time Series Analysis, 10. , Princeton, NJ, USA: Princeton Univ.

In the field of machine learning, artificial neural networks have been used to carry out these tasks. However, there are still problems that are of general interest to researchers such as: Loss of data in data acquisition and long-term forecast. In this paper, we propose a hybrid Meta-Transfer Learning technique based on transfer-learning, meta-learning and signal detection by means of the discrete wavelet transform to solve the aforementioned problems in multi-horizon time series forecasting. Input-to-state stability analysis and the strong and weak convergence analysis for the proposed method are included. To validate the effectiveness of the method, the long-term prediction of earthquakes magnitude (M>4.5) in Italy is taken as a case of study, using information from Italy and Mexico. Simulations of classic methods for forecasting time series based on neural models are performed. The forecasting performance obtained is the minimum square error (MSE) is 0.091, while for the meta-transfer learning, the MSE is 0.032. © 2022 IEEE.","Deep learning; meta-transfer learning; stable learning; time series forecasting; wavelet decomposition","Data acquisition; Deep learning; Earthquakes; Forecasting; Neural networks; Signal reconstruction; Time series analysis; Wavelet decomposition; Deep learning; Meta-transfer learning; Neural-networks; Predictive models; Stable learning; Task analysis; Time series forecasting; Time-series analysis; Transfer learning; Wavelets decomposition; Discrete wavelet transforms",,,,,"Nath, P., Saha, P., Middya, A.I., Roy, S., Long-term time-series pollution forecast using statistical and deep learning methods (2021) Neural Comput.

Nevertheless, load forecasting remains a challenge owing to the high dimensionality and volatility of electrical load data as time series. In this study, a feature extraction framework for electrical load and other complementary data as a multivariate time series is proposed. The proposed framework consists of tagging and embedding processes that extract patterns from the multivariate time series as tags and capture their temporal and dimensional relations. In the embedding process, a network model that embeds the tags is deliberately designed with a convolutional layer in a multi-output structure based on mathematical analysis. Furthermore, a deep learning-based STLF model is constructed with the proposed feature extraction framework. The performance of the proposed STLF model for day-ahead load forecasting is evaluated on a publicly available set of real electricity demand data. The experimental results verify that the proposed approach reduces the root mean squared error by 5% to 12%. This improvement in load forecasts can benefit power grid operations as it provides more accurate expectations on the behaviors of the power grid in short term, which can be utilized in power grid applications, such as power dispatch and scheduling.

Current state-of-the-art deep learning forecasting methods, often trained with variants of the MSE, lack the ability to provide sharp predictions in deterministic and probabilistic contexts. To handle these challenges, we propose to incorporate shape and temporal criteria in the training objective of deep models. We define shape and temporal similarities and dissimilarities, based on a smooth relaxation of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Temporal Distortion Index (TDI), that enable to build differentiable loss functions and positive semi-definite (PSD) kernels. With these tools, we introduce DILATE (DIstortion Loss including shApe and TimE), a new objective for deterministic forecasting, that explicitly incorporates two terms supporting precise shape and temporal change detection. For probabilistic forecasting, we introduce STRIPE++ (Shape and Time diverRsIty in Probabilistic forEcasting), a framework for providing a set of sharp and diverse forecasts, where the structured shape and time diversity is enforced with a determinantal point process (DPP) diversity loss. Extensive experiments and ablations studies on synthetic and real-world datasets confirm the benefits of leveraging shape and time features in time series forecasting.

In this article, we present a novel approach developed from the perspective of granular computing (GrC) to realize the long-term prediction of time series. The proposed method first employs a sliding window strategy to smooth on the raw time series. Subsequently, the smoothed time series is transformed into the corresponding granular time series that is depicted by evolving shape with the aid of the clustering algorithm based on the dynamic time warping (DTW) distance. Finally, a Takagi-Sugeno (TS) architecture-like granular model (GrM) is formed by deriving the relations implying in the granular time series and offers the granular output in the numeric vector format. The GrM adopts the pattern-to-pattern inference mechanism to realize the long-term prediction of time series at the vector level. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate that the proposed method not only has the ability to circumvent the cumulative error but also makes the resulting GrM equip better interpretability.

According to statistics, a long short-term memory network (LSTM) is the first choice for deep learning to deal with the financial time series predicting problems due to its internal memory that can process incoming input with the previous state. However, most of the research used the raw financial time series data composed of opening, closing, highest, lowest price, and transactional time as learning features to feed into models. This study proposed a novel approach focusing on appropriate structures that can organize the price activities as a bell shape curve and identify the greed and fear in the market with deep convolutional neural networks. In addition, this study also considered the influence of time causality on patterns. It is difficult to accurately catch the rapid changes in the market, especially the causal link between various patterns and trend reversal behavior while using only static features extracted by AI models. We designed disparate methods while generating images that could keep the time-variant features on structures and be extracted by convolutional neural networks. Each image was labeled as the upward trend to downward trend, downward trend to upward trend, and trend did not change according to reversals of overall price direction. Finally, to evaluate the availability of the trained model, two-stage experiments were carried out. The first stage of the experiment mainly evaluated the accuracy and profitability of trades following the models, and the second stage considered practical trading rules such as the stop-loss mechanism. The results of the first and second stages showed the proposed models had better profitability and extremely well-matched classification capabilities when compared with the state-of-the-art deep learning models. © 2013 IEEE.","Algorithmic trading; convolutional neural network; deep learning; financial time series forecasting; market profile; price structure; time causality; trend reversals","Commerce; Convolution; Costs; Deep neural networks; Electronic trading; Feature extraction; Financial markets; Investments; Long short-term memory; Market Research; Profitability; Time series analysis; Algorithmic trading; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Features extraction; Financial time series forecasting; Market profile; Market researches; Price structure; Time causality; Time-series analysis; Trend reversal; Forecasting",,,,,"Sezer, O.B., Gudelek, M.U., Ozbayoglu, A.M., Financial time series forecasting with deep learning : A systematic literature review: 2005-2019 (2020) Appl.

The BSS has several swapping bays such that each can accommodate an EV for swapping single or multiple battery units. The proposed BSS model considers serving different types of EVs using a heterogeneous battery stock. The charging of the depleted batteries (DBs) is performed using continuously controlled variable chargers which makes it more flexible for providing grid services. While previous studies focused on day-ahead modeling of BSSs, our study considers BSS dynamic scheduling. The goal is to maximize the daily profit using an RHO mechanism to provide optimal swapping and charging/discharging processes. The problem is defined as mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP), then it's linearized into a mixed-integer linear problem (MILP) to reduce the computational complexity. To predict the EV's swapping demand, a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network is utilized as a time series forecasting engine. The proposed model is validated through a set of case studies comparing the LSTM-based RHO mechanism versus unscheduled operation and day-ahead scheduling. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed dynamic scheduling mechanism increases the profit between 10&#x0025; and 25.7&#x0025; compared to the day-ahead scheduling. Furthermore, the number of EVs served using the proposed approach increases between 11&#x0025; and 14&#x0025; compared to the day-ahead model.

The existing studies for ITS forecasting only consider basic descriptive information such as center, radius, upper and lower bounds, and overlooks the distribution information within the data interval. In this study, an interval-valued time series forecasting scheme based on probability distribution information features of interval-valued data with machine learning algorithms is proposed to enhance electric power generation forecasting. In the proposed scheme, the central tendency features and dispersion features from the interval-valued data are designed as integrated features sets (IFS) and used as predictor variables. Three methods including supper vector regression and extreme learning machine and multivariate adaptive regression splines based on the IFS are utilized to develop ITS forecasting models. The daily time series of the metered generation from the Australian Energy Market Operator is used to illustrate the proposed scheme. Empirical results show that the proposed ITS forecasting schemes with IFS outperform the eight benchmark models and thus validate that the proposed scheme is an effective alternative for interval-valued electric power generation forecasting. © 2013 IEEE.","Feature engineering; Interval-valued forecasting; Machine learning; Power generation prediction; Probability distribution","Artificial intelligence; Biological systems; Electric power generation; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Time series analysis; Weather forecasting; Adaptation models; Biological system modeling; Feature engineerings; Generation predictions; Interval-valued; Interval-valued forecasting; Power generation prediction; Power- generations; Predictive models; Probability: distributions; Time-series analysis; Wind forecasting; Probability distributions",,,,,"Semero, Y.K., Zhang, J., Zheng, D., PV power forecasting using an integrated GA-PSO-ANFIS approach and Gaussian process regression based feature selection strategy (2018) CSEE J.

To mitigate these issues, renewable energies (like solar, wind, and hydropower) are blessings for modern energy sectors. The study focuses on wind-speed prediction in energy forecasting applications. This paper is a comprehensive review of deep neural network based approaches, like the “nonlinear autoregressive exogenous inputs (NARX)”, “nonlinear input-output (NIO)” and “nonlinear autoregressive (NAR)” neural network models, in time-series forecasting applications. This study proposed NARX based prediction models in wind-speed forecasting for short-term scheme. The meteorological parameters related to wind time-series have been analyzed, and used for evaluating the performance of the proposed models. The experiments revealed the best performance of the prediction models in terms of “mean square error (MSE)”, “correlation-coefficient (R2)”, “auto-correlation”, “error-histogram”, and “input-error cross-correlation”. Comparing with the other neural network models, like “recurrent neural network (RNN)” and “curve fitting neural network (CFNN)” models, the NARX-based prediction model achieved better performance in regard to “auto-correlation”, “error-histogram”, “input-error cross-correlation”, and training time. The results also showed that the RNN and CFNN models performed better prediction accuracy with R2 and MSE values. While this performance index is slightly higher, it is negligible in forecasting applications and concluded that the proposed NARX-based model achieved the better prediction accuracy in terms of other performance evaluation measures. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","NARX neural network; Recurrent neural network; Renewable energy; Time-series forecasting; Wind-speed prediction","Curve fitting; Deep neural networks; Errors; Forecasting; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Global warming; Graphic methods; Mean square error; Recurrent neural networks; Time series; Time series analysis; Wind; Forecasting: applications; NARX neural network; Network-based approach; Neural network model; Performance; Prediction modelling; Renewable energies; Time series forecasting; Wind speed prediction; Wind time series; Greenhouse gases",,,,,"Shoaib, M., Siddiqui, I., Rehman, S., Khan, S., Alhems, L.M., Assessment of wind energy potential using wind energy conversion system (2019) J Clean Prod, 216, pp. 346-360; (2020) Renewable Energy Use, 1990-2019 (Indicator 0385, Version 36, 8 September 2020), , www.environmentaldata.nl, Statistics Netherlands (CBS), The Hague; PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, The Hague; RIVM National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, Bilthoven; and Wageningen University and Research, Wageningen.

Traditionally, statistical or machine learning models for time series forecasting are trained with the historical values of the series to be forecast. Unfortunately, some time series are too short to suitably train a model. Motivated by this fact, this paper explores the use of data available in a pool or collection of time series to train a model that predicts an individual series. Concretely, we train a generalized regression neural network with the examples drawn from the historical values of a pool of series and then use the model to forecast individual series. In this sense several approaches are proposed, including to draw the examples from a pool of series related to the series to be forecast or the training of several models with mutually exclusive series and the combination of their forecasts. Experimental results in terms of forecasting accuracy using generalized regression neural networks are promising. Furthermore, the proposed approaches allow to forecast series that are too short to build a traditional generalized regression neural network model. © 2013 IEEE.","Generalized regression neural networks; Model combination; Time series forecasting","Forecasting; Lakes; Learning systems; Regression analysis; Time series analysis; Generalized regression; Generalized regression neural network; Model combination; Neural-networks; Predictive models; Proposal; Regression neural networks; Smoothing methods; Time series forecasting; Time-series analysis; Neural networks",,,,,"Deb, C., Zhang, F., Yang, J., Lee, S.E., Shah, K.W., A review on time series forecasting techniques for building energy consumption (2017) Renew.

Despite their efficiency and low training cost, practical applications of RCNs rely heavily on empirical design. In this article, we develop an algorithm to design RCNs using the realization theory of linear dynamical systems. In particular, we introduce the notion of &#x03B1;-stable realization and provide an efficient approach to prune the size of a linear RCN without deteriorating the training accuracy. Furthermore, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition on the irreducibility of the number of hidden nodes in linear RCNs based on the concepts of controllability and observability from systems theory. Leveraging the linear RCN design, we provide a tractable procedure to realize RCNs with nonlinear activation functions. We present numerical experiments on forecasting time-delay systems and chaotic systems to validate the proposed RCN design methods and demonstrate their efficacy.

However, in the presence of a structural break, multiple series can be transferred from one homogeneous state to another over a comparatively short time breaking this assumption. As a consequence, forecasting performance can degrade significantly. In this paper, we propose a state-dependent model to incorporate the movement of states in the linear recurrent formula called a State-Dependent Multivariate SSA (SD-MSSA) model. The proposed model is examined for its reliability in the presence of a structural break by conducting an empirical analysis covering both synthetic and real data. Comparison with standard MSSA, BVAR, VAR and VECM models shows the proposed model outperforms all three models significantly. © 2021 The Authors.

In this ongoing conflict, it is important to analyse the properties of the vulnerability time series to understand when information systems are more vulnerable. We study computer systems’ software vulnerabilities and probe the relevant National Vulnerability Database (NVD) time-series properties. More specifically, we show through an extensive experimental study based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) database that the relevant systems software time series present significant chaotic properties. Moreover, by defining some systems based on open and closed source software, we compare their chaotic properties resulting in statistical conclusions. The contribution of this novel study is focused on the prepossessing stage of vulnerabilities time series forecasting. The strong evidence of their chaotic properties as derived by this research effort could lead to a deeper analysis to provide additional tools to their forecasting process. © 2021 by the authors.

In these domains, owing to the complex dependencies among multiple variables and the mixed dependencies in the time dimension, it is challenging to forecast a multivariate time series precisely. Furthermore, most of the forecasting methods fail to capture the mixed influence of the different time-length dependencies among multiple variables. In this paper, a new deep learning framework is proposed for dealing with this challenging problem, named as mixed dependence time-series network (MDTNet). In this framework, stacked dilated convolutions and recurrent units are applied to extract the complex patterns in the long- and short-term mixed dependencies among multiple variables. The experiments show that our proposed framework yields significant results, outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline methods on three of the four benchmark datasets in large horizons and achieving a competitive performance in short horizons on all the benchmark datasets. © 2021","Dependency; Forecasting; Multivariate time series","Benchmarking; Complex networks; Deep learning; Large dataset; Solar energy; Time series; Benchmark datasets; Dependency; Electricity-consumption; Energy; Multivariate time series; Short term; Term dependency; Time dimension; Time series forecasting; Traffic management; Forecasting; article; deep learning; forecasting; time series analysis",,,,,"Box, G.E., Jenkins, G.M., Reinsel, G.C., Ljung, G.M., Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control (2015), John Wiley & Sons; Hamilton, J.D., (1994) Time Series Analysis, 2. , Cambridge Univ Press; Lütkepohl, H., New Introduction to Multiple Time Series Analysis (2005), Springer Science & Business Media; Roberts, S., Osborne, M., Ebden, M., Reece, S., Gibson, N., Aigrain, S., Gaussian processes for time-series modelling (2013) Philosophical Transactions.

Nevertheless, most of them do not consider mining the hidden patterns in the cross-regional financial time-series. However, the fluctuation in financial markets has always been affected by the global economy, instead of a single market. To overcome this issue, this article proposes an Attention enhanced Compound Neural Network (AComNN) that can be applied on features of multiple-sources, including different financial markets and economic entities. The proposed novel approach compounds of Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and self-attention to progressively capture the time-zone-dependent context behind the financial time-series across regions with multiple filters. Thereby, it provides trading signals for supporting the financial investment decision. The proposed AComNN has been applied on the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index (HSI) trend prediction based on various initial features across regions. The experimental result demonstrates that the AComNN achieves the highest average accuracy for the one-day ahead trend prediction over 60%. Besides, it reveals highly superior competitiveness on the forecasting capability improved by 13.36% on average compared with the baselines. Therefore, we encourage to adopt the proposed method to the practitioners and provide a new thought, considering the analysis of cross-regional features, in the financial time-series forecasting. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Attention mechanism; Deep learning; Financial time-series forecasting; Hang Seng Index","Commerce; Electronic trading; Filtration; Financial markets; Forecasting; Investments; Long short-term memory; Time series; Financial investments; Financial time series; Financial time series forecasting; Forecasting capability; Global economies; Investment decisions; Regional feature; Trend prediction; Time series analysis",,,,,"Abu-Mostafa, Y.S., Atiya, A.F., Introduction to financial forecasting (1996) Appl.

At present, most of the proposed methods use direct prediction based on bearing vibration signals, which not only have low prediction accuracy but also time-consuming. This paper proposes a staged prediction method, and the regularized learning machine (RELM) based on the proposed sensitive degradation feature is applied to predict RUL of the bearing with high accuracy and speed. Firstly, the relative root mean square value (RRMS) is used to divide the degradation stages of rolling bearings. Secondly, the RRMS indicator is used for multi-step time series prediction in the normal phase of the bearing. Thirdly, in the bearing's degradation stage, the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) Combined Entropy Weight Method (EWM) feature selection criterion is proposed to predict the RUL of the rolling bearing. Finally, the sensitive degradation feature of the bearing vibration signals is input into RELM to predict the RUL. The bearing data sets of PHM Challenging 2012 are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Three comparative experiments have been verified to prove the accuracy and rapidity of the proposed method in time series forecasting. © IMechE 2021.","degradation stage division; regularized learning machine; Rolling bearing; RUL prediction; time series prediction","Correlation methods; Degradation; Forecasting; Machine learning; Time series; Time series analysis; Comparative experiments; Entropy weight method; Extreme learning machine; Pearson correlation coefficients; Prediction accuracy; Remaining useful lives; Root mean square values; Time series forecasting; Roller bearings",,,,,"Albrecht, P.F., Appiarius, J.C., McCoy, R.M., Assessment of the reliability of motors in utility applications – updated (1986) IEEE Trans Energy Convers, EC-1, pp. 39-46; Lei, Y., Li, N., Guo, L., Machinery health prognostics: a systematic review from data acquisition to RUL prediction (2018) Mech Syst Signal Process, 104, pp. 799-834; Hu, Y., Baraldi, P., Maio, F.D., Online performance assessment method for a model-based prognostic approach (2015) IEEE Trans Reliabil, 65, pp. 1-18; Jin, X.H., Sun, Y., Que, Z.J., Anomaly detection and fault prognosis for bearings (2016) IEEE Trans Instrum Meas, 65, pp. 2046-2054; Liu, Z.L., Zuo, M.J., Qin, Y., Remaining useful life prediction of rolling element bearings based on health state assessment (2016) Proc Inst Mech Eng C J Mech Eng Sci, 230, pp. 314-330; Rai, A., Upadhyay, S.H., Intelligent bearing performance degradation assessment and remaining useful life prediction based on self-organising map and support vector regression (2018) Proc Inst Mech Eng C J Mech Eng Sci, 232, pp. 1118-1132; Qian, Y., Yan, R., Hu, S., Bearing degradation evaluation using recurrence quantification analysis and Kalman filter (2014) IEEE Trans Instrum Meas, 63, pp. 2599-2610; Lei, Y., Li, N., Gontarz, S., A model-based method for remaining useful life prediction of machinery (2016) IEEE Trans Reliab, 65, pp. 1314-1326; Wang, Y., Peng, Y., Zi, Y., A two-stage data-driven-based prognostic approach for bearing degradation problem (2016) IEEE Trans Ind Inf, 12, pp. 924-932; Elforjani, M., Shanbr, S., Prognosis of bearing acoustic emission signals using supervised machine learning (2018) IEEE Trans Ind Electron, 65, pp. 5864-5871; Tian, Z., An artificial neural network method for remaining useful life prediction of equipment subject to condition monitoring (2012) J Intell Manuf, 23, pp. 227-237; Zan, T., Liu, Z., Wang, H., Prediction of performance deterioration of rolling bearing based on JADE and PSO-SVM, , Epub ahead of print 17 August 2020; Yan, M.M., Wang, X.G., Wang, B.X., Bearing remaining useful life prediction using support vector machine and hybrid degradation tracking model (2020) Isa Trans, 98, pp. 471-482; García Nieto, P.J., García-Gonzalo, E., Sánchez Lasheras, F., Hybrid PSO–SVM-based method for forecasting of the remaining useful life for aircraft engines and evaluation of its reliability (2015) Reliab Eng Syst Saf, 138, pp. 219-231; Wang, F., Mamo, T.J.Q., Engineering, R., Hybrid approach for remaining useful life prediction of ball bearings (2019) Qual Reliab Eng, 35, pp. 2494-2505. , and; Zhang, L., Alharbe, N.R., Luo, G., A hybrid forecasting framework based on support vector regression with a modified genetic algorithm and a random forest for traffic flow prediction (2018) Tinshhua Sci Technol, 23, pp. 479-492; Yongbin, L., Bing, H., Fang, L., Remaining useful life prediction of rolling bearings using PSR, JADE, and extreme learning machine (2016) Math Probl Eng, 2016, pp. 1-13; Lu, F., Wu, J., Huang, J., Novel extreme learning machine using Kalman filter for performance prediction of aircraft engine in dynamic behavior (2020) J Aerosp Eng, 33, p. 04020053; Accurate bearing remaining useful life prediction based on Weibull distribution and artificial neural network (2015) Mech Syst Signal Process, 56-57, pp. 150-172. , Ali JB, Chebel-Morello B, Saidi L, et al; Wu, J., Wu, C., Cao, S., Degradation Data-Driven Time-To-Failure prognostics approach for rolling element bearings in electrical machines (2019) Ieee Trans Ind Electron, 66, pp. 529-539; Soualhi, A., Medjaher, K., Zerhouni, N., Bearing health monitoring based on Hilbert-Huang transform, support vector machine and regression (2015) Ieee Trans Instrum Meas, 64, pp. 52-62; Wenbin, W., A model to predict the residual life of rolling element bearings given monitored condition information to date (2002) IMA J Manage Math, 13, pp. 3-16; Blake, M.P., Mitchell, W.S., (1972) Vibration and acoustic measurement handbook, , New York, NY, Spartan Books; Li, N., Lei, Y., Lin, J., An improved exponential model for predicting remaining useful life of rolling element bearings (2015) IEEE Trans Ind Electron, 62, pp. 7762-7773; Saha, S., Saha, B., Saxena, A., (2010), Distributed prognostic health management with Gaussian process regression.

Predicting new and urgent trends in epidemiological data is an effective way to prevent influenza outbreaks and protect public health. Traditional autoregressive(AR) methods and new deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) have been actively studied to solve the problem. Most existing studies focus on the short-term prediction of influenza. Recently, Transformer models show superior performance in capturing long-range dependency than RNN models. In this paper, we develop a Transformer-based model, which utilizes the potential of the Transformer to increase the prediction capacity. To fuse information from data of different sources and capture the spatial dependency, we design a sources selection module based on measuring curve similarity. Our model is compared with the widely used AR models and RNN-based models on USA and Japan datasets. Results show that our approach provides approximate performance in short-term forecasting and better performance in long-term forecasting. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Deep learning; Influenza forecasting; Time-series forecasting; Transformer","Backpropagation; Forecasting; Autoregressive methods; Long-range dependencies; Long-term forecasting; Long-term prediction; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Short term prediction; Short-term forecasting; Spatial dependencies; Recurrent neural networks; Article; autoregressive model; compartment model; deep learning; human; Japan; natural language processing; prediction and forecasting; recurrent neural network; seasonal influenza; time series analysis; Transformer based model; United States; virus transmission",,,,,"Molinari, N.-A.M., Ortega-Sanchez, I.R., Messonnier, M.L., Thompson, W.W., Wortley, P.M., Weintraub, E., Bridges, C.B., The annual impact of seasonal influenza in the us: Measuring disease burden and costs (2007) Vaccine, 25 (27), pp. 5086-5096; Flu, S.I., Estimated influenza illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths averted by vaccination in the United States (2007) Prevent, 2008, pp. 2006-2007; Osterholm, M.T., Kelley, N.S., Sommer, A., Belongia, E.A., Efficacy and effectiveness of influenza vaccines: a systematic review and meta-analysis (2012) Lancet.

Understanding energy market dynamics is essential to improving grid efficiency and optimizing the development of new energy conversion and storage technologies. Accurate energy price forecasts are important for many energy storage technologies to be profitable from price arbitrage. In this paper, we apply Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), a popular spatial-temporal reduced-form modeling technique, to forecast 6587 locational marginal prices in the California Day-Ahead Market (DAM). DMD is a promising equation-free modeling technique in systems with inherent periodic tendencies in time such as financial markets and fluid dynamics. Yet we show, for the first time, that DMD cannot reliably forecast day-ahead energy prices due to the periodicity of the data. Instead, we show Augmented DMD (ADMD) overcomes these limitations and is a fast and accurate price forecaster. We benchmark DMD, ADMD, and backcasting forecasting methods for optimal price arbitrage with an energy storage system. Using ADMD, a market-connected energy storage system can capture up to 92% of allowable revenues in rolling horizon simulations. Moreover, ADMD is up to 1000-times faster than time-series forecasting methods and requires orders of magnitude less data than deep/machine learning techniques. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",,"Costs; Deep learning; Digital storage; Dynamics; Energy conversion; Forecasting; Dynamic mode decompositions; Energy; Energy markets; Energy prices; Energy storage technologies; Forecasting methods; Modelling techniques; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Storage systems; Wholesale energy market; Power markets; energy market; fluid dynamics; forecasting method; numerical model; optimization; simulation; spatiotemporal analysis; time series analysis; California; United States",,,,,"Sioshansi, F.P., (2013) Evolution of Global Electricity Markets: new paradigms, new challenges, new approaches, , Academic Press; Dowling, A.W., Kumar, R., Zavala, V.M., A multi-scale optimization framework for electricity market participation (2017) Appl Energy, 190, pp. 147-164; Shao, Y., Zavala, V.M., Space-time dynamics of electricity markets incentivize technology decentralization (2019) Comput Chem Eng, 127, pp. 31-40; http://oasis.caiso.com/, [link].

Graphical time series models are a class of multivariate time series to model the spatio-temporal dependencies between the sensors. Constructing graph-based models involve data pre-processing and correlation analysis to capture the dynamics of different water flow scenarios, which is not scalable for a large network of sensors. This paper presents a novel approach to model spatio-temporal dependencies across river network stations using a partial correlation graph. We also provide a method to enrich this partial correlation graph by eliminating the spurious correlations. We demonstrate the utility of enriched partial correlation graphs in multivariate forecasting for various scenarios and state-of-the-art multivariate forecasting models. We observe that the forecasting techniques that use information from the enriched partial correlation graph outperform standard time series forecasting approaches for river network forecasting. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","ARIMA; Graph analysis; Partial correlation graph; River networks; River stage forecasting; Timeseries forecasting","Correlation methods; Data handling; Flow graphs; Flow of water; Graphic methods; Rivers; Time series; Correlation analysis; Forecasting problems; Forecasting techniques; Multivariate forecasting; Multivariate time series; Partial correlation; Spatio-temporal dependencies; Time series forecasting; Forecasting; correlation; forecasting method; graphical method; sensor; spatiotemporal analysis; time series analysis; water flow",,,,,"Ahmed, N.K., Atiya, A.F., Gayar, N.E., El-Shishiny, H., An empirical comparison of machine learning models for time series forecasting (2010) Economet Rev, 29 (5-6), pp. 594-621; Athanasopoulos, G., Poskitt, D.S., Vahid, F., Two canonicalvarma forms: Scalar component models vis-‘a-vis the echelon form (2012) Economet Rev, 31 (1), pp. 60-83; Barigozzi, M., Brownlees, C., Nets: Network estimation for time-series (2019) J Appl Economet, 34 (3), pp. 347-364; Bowden, G.J., Dandy, G.C., Maier, H.R., Input determination for neural network models in water resources applications. part 1–background and methodology (2005) J Hydrol, 301 (1-4), pp. 75-92; Chau, K., River stage forecasting with particle swarm optimization (2004) International Conference on Industrial, Engineering and Other Applications of Applied Intelligent Systems, pp. 1166-1173. , Springer; Cohen, J., Cohen, P., West, S.G., Aiken, L.S., (2013) Applied Multiple Regression/Correlation Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences, , Routledge; Dahlhaus, R., Graphical interaction models for multivariate time-series 1 (2000) Metrika, 51 (2), pp. 157-172; De La Fuente, A., Bing, N., Hoeschele, I., Mendes, P., Discovery of meaningful associations in genomic data using partial correlation coefficients (2004) Bioinformatics, 20 (18), pp. 3565-3574; Diebold, F.X., Comparing predictive accuracy twenty years later: a personal perspective on the use and abuse of diebold-mariano tests (2015) J Bus Econ Stat, 33 (1), p. 1; Diebold, F.X., Mariano, R.S., Comparing predictive accuracy (2002) J Bus Econ Stat, 20 (1), pp. 134-144; Epskamp, S., Fried, E.I., A tutorial on regularized partial correlation networks (2018) Psychol Methods, 23 (4), p. 617; Fernando, T., Maier, H., Dandy, G., Selection of input variables for data driven models: an average shifted histogram partial mutual information estimator approach (2009) J Hydrol, 367 (3-4), pp. 165-176; Fildes, R., The evaluation of extrapolative forecasting methods (1992) Int J Forecast, 8 (1), pp. 81-98; Fu, J.-C., Huang, H.-Y., Jang, J.-H., Huang, P.-H., River stage forecasting using multiple additive regression trees (2019) Water Resour Manage, 33 (13), pp. 4491-4507; Galelli, S., Castelletti, A., Tree-based iterative input variable selection for hydrological modeling (2013) Water Resour Res, 49 (7), pp. 4295-4310; Harvey, D., Leybourne, S., Newbold, P., Testing the equality of prediction mean squared errors (1997) Int J Forecast, 13 (2), pp. 281-291; Irvine, K.N., Eberhardt, A.J., Multiplicative, seasonal arima models for lake erie and lake ontario water levels 1 (1992) JAWRA J Am Water Resour Assoc, 28 (2), pp. 385-396; Kenett, D.Y., Tumminello, M., Madi, A., Gur-Gershgoren, G., Mantegna, R.N., Ben-Jacob, E., Dominating clasp of the financial sector revealed by partial correlation analysis of the stock market (2010) PLoS One, 5 (12); Knight, M.I., (2016) Nunes MA, , Nason GP, Modelling, detrending and decorrelation ofnetwork time-series. arxiv. preprint; Lohani, A.K., Goel, N., Bhatia, K., Improving real time flood forecasting using fuzzy inference system (2014) J Hydrol, 509, pp. 25-41; Maier, H.R., Jain, A., Dandy, G.C., Sudheer, K.P., Methods used for the development of neural networks for the prediction of water resource variables in river systems: current status and future directions (2010) Environ Model Software, 25 (8), pp. 891-909; Marrelec, G., Krainik, A., Duffau, H., Pélégrini-Issac, M., Lehéricy, S., Doyon, J., Benali, H., Partial correlation for functional brain interactivity investigation in functional mri (2006) Neuroimage, 32 (1), pp. 228-237; Millington, T., Niranjan, M., Partial correlation financial networks (2020) Appl Netw Sci, 5 (1), pp. 1-19; Min, W., Wynter, L., Amemiya, Y., (2007) Road traffic prediction with spatio-temporal correlations.

For the long-term development of the industry, many countries and enterprises began to make demand forecasts with different levels for the product market. The same is true for China's civil aircraft-related industries. There are a variety of predictive models, but not all of them are appropriate for the prediction of civil aircraft market demand. This paper introduces a variety of modelling methods for forecasting models, including time series forecasting models and causal analysis forecasting models. The contribution of our work is the adoption of a new coefficient determination method to establish a variable-weight combination forecasting model, which greatly improves the forecasting accuracy. In addition, we also propose a new and more stable prediction model, the chain prediction model. Simulation prediction is carried out for each model in this work. Through the analysis and comparison of the prediction results, we conclude that the prediction effects of the variable weight combination prediction model and the chain prediction model are superior to those of other single prediction models. The chain prediction model in particular has better performance in medium- A nd long-term prediction, compared with the other prediction models. Finally, the model is applied to predict the demand of Chinese civil aircraft in the next 20 years, which confirms that the Chinese civil aircraft market will expand in the future. © 2021 The Author(s).

This method includes identifying, analyzing, forecasting the risks of industrial accidents as well as assessing the possible extent of their consequences. All calculations should be made in a timely manner to take the necessary measures to prevent accidents. The technological complexity of enterprises is a complex system consisting of various components. The risks of failure of these components pose a security risk. Critical enterprises monitoring systems are introduced in order to increase the level of safety. These systems monitor the state of the nodes of the technological complex and predict the behavior of key indicators for a given period. The effectiveness of industrial safety management depends on the accuracy of these predictions. Various methods can be used to assess forecast. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the criteria used to assess the quality of forecast models and recommendations for their usage in practical life. Various coefficients based on residuals are used to assess the applicability of a particular model. As shown in the results of our research, not all indicators should be used in industrial safety systems.

Predicting for shorter intervals requires lower execution time combined with higher accuracy. To deal with this issue, an ensemble model is proposed with the fixed-batch-training method. To excel in the execution time, a fixed-batch-training method is used. On the other hand, the ensemble of multiple machine learning algorithms provides higher accuracy. The experimental result shows that this predictive model can produce at least 10% higher accuracy in comparison with the other available widely used short-term time series forecasting models. In the studied medical system, this gain in accuracy for the earlier prediction of workload can reduce the Medicare relative value unit cost by $1.1 million annually, which we have formulated and shown in this paper.

Their feature is the mathematical and statistical base and formalization of the requirements for the parameters’ selection, which makes them relevant and effective. The article describes an algorithm for analyzing time series representing changes in the integral risk indicator and its modeling using various autoregressive models with subsequent comparison of their adequacy and quality evaluation of the resulting forecast.

It is a well-known fact that improving time series prediction accuracy is a vital yet challenging issue. Recently, soft computing has become popular in time series forecasting in various application areas. Soft computing is a fusion of research of evolutionary and genetic algorithms, neural networks, fuzzy set theory, and fuzzy systems and provides rapid dissemination of results. This study investigates a model for time series water-level prediction using soft computing techniques which is reliable and effective. To illustrate the applicability and capability of soft computing, the Jamuna river, Bangladesh, was used as a case study. We used four areas of the Jamuna river (i.e., Aricha, Bahdurabad, Shariacandi, and Sirajganj) water-level and rainfall events with daily data collected in the past 12 years. In experiments, past 2 to 4 days’ time-series wa-ter-level with and without rainfall has been applied to predict 1 to 4 days ahead water-level. The experimental results demonstrated that the adaptive neurofuzzy inference system (ANFIS) performs superiorly to traditional methods, such as nonlinear autoregressive neural network with external input (NARX) and focused time-delay neural network (FTDNN). © 2021","ANFIS; FTDNN; NARX; soft-computing; Time series analysis; water-level prediction",,,,,,"Abbasi, E., Abouec, A., Stock price forecast by using neuro-fuzzy inference system (2008) World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology, 2 (10), pp. 1114-1117; Abdulsalam, S.

This model has been applied to solve various modeling tasks including forecasting time series. In the original FCM-based forecasting model, causal relationships among concepts of the FCM remain unchanged. However, causal relationships may change in time. Therefore, we propose a new learning method for training an FCM resulting in an adaptive FCM which consists of several sub-FCMs. It can select different sub-FCMs at different moments. In an active processing scenario, in which we deal with a large-scale time series with new data being continuously generated, a forecasting model built on the old data should be updated when the new data arrive. Furthermore, retraining an FCM from scratch entails increasing computing overhead that will become a serious obstacle in many practical scenarios. To overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings, this study offers an original design setting in which the FCM is updated by knowledge-guidance learning mechanism for the first time. Compared with the existing classical forecasting models, the proposed model shows higher accuracy and efficiency. Its increased performance is demonstrated through a series of reported experimental studies.

One key difficulty in managing the outbreak at the national level is that due to the US' diversity, geographic spread, and economic inequality, the COVID-19 pandemic in the US acts more as a series of diverse regional outbreaks rather than a synchronized homogeneous one. Method: In order to determine how to assess regional risk related to COVID-19, a two-phase modeling approach is developed while considering demographic and economic criteria. First, an unsupervised clustering technique, specifically k-means, is employed to group US counties based on demographic and economic similarities. Then, time series forecasting of each cluster of counties is developed to assess the short-run viral transmissibility risk. Results: To this end, we test ARIMA and Seasonal Trend Random Walk forecasts to determine which is more appropriate for modeling the spread and lethality of COVID-19. From our analysis, we then utilize the superior ARIMA models to forecast future COVID-19 trends in the clusters, and present the areas in the US which have the highest COVID-19 related risk heading into the winter of 2020. Conclusion: Including sub-national socioeconomic characteristics to data-driven COVID-19 infection and fatality forecasts may play a key role in assessing the risk associated with changes in infection patterns at the national level. © 2020 IEEE.","ARIMA; COVID-19; data analytics; means clustering; time series analysis","Autoregressive moving average model; Diseases; Economics; Forecasting; K-means clustering; Population statistics; Viruses; Economic criteria; Economic inequality; Infection patterns; Seasonal trends; Socio-economic data; Socioeconomic characteristics; Time series forecasting; Unsupervised clustering technique; Risk assessment",,,,,"COVID-19 United States Accessed (2020) Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, , https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/us-map; Shereen, M.A., Khan, S., Kazmi, A., Bashir, N., Siddique, R., COVID-19 infection: Origin, transmission, and characteristics of human coronaviruses (2020) J.

Frequent Crimes are the extreme hindrance to the sustainable development of a nation and thus need to be controlled. Often Police personnel seek the computational solution and tools to realize impending crimes and to perform crime analytics. The developed and developing countries experimenting their tryst with predictive policing in the recent times. With the advent of advanced machine and deep learning algorithms, Time series analysis and building a forecasting model on crime data sets has become feasible. Time series analysis is preferred on this data set as the crime events are recorded with respect to time as significant component. The objective of this paper is to mechanize and automate time series forecasting using a pure DL model. N-Beats Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are the proven ensemble models for time series forecasting. Herein, we had foreseen future trends with better accuracy by building a model using NBeats algorithm on Sacremento crime data set. This study applied detailed data pre-processing steps, presented an extensive set of visualizations and involved hyperparameter tuning. The current study has been compared with the other similar works and had been proved as a better forecasting model.

(e-mail: jjxyghj@126.com)","An increasing number of scholars have tried to incorporate external factors affecting the disturbance of a time series into their forecasting models. However, these studies only verify the linkage relationship of two or more time series by empirical tests without providing any theoretical explanation. This makes it difficult to choose a linkage time series without using many tests. In this paper, a novel two-factor fuzzy-fluctuation time series (FFTS) forecasting model is proposed based on the probabilistic linguistic preference relationship (PLPR) and similarity measure. It not only proposes the idea of combining external factors with internal potential trends but also explains the linkage mechanism of time series fluctuations from the perspective of behavioral preference. Specifically, the probabilistic linguistic preference logical relationship (PLPLR) is employed to express the fluctuation behavior rule and preference attribute from the history testing dataset. The Euclidean distance or Hamming distance between the &#x201C;current state&#x201D; and the left side of training PLPLRs is introduced as a similarity comparison method for the identification of appropriate rules. The proposed model is tested using a traditional time series (e.g., the enrollment of the University of Alabama) to compare its performance with existing models. The model is also employed to forecast realistic stock markets, such as the Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX) and Hang Seng Index (HSI).

This paper puts forward a novel granulation algorithm involving two-stage partitioning scheme so that information granule established there exhibits well-articulated semantics at the time level, while at the same time, it gives full consideration to the varying patterns of data. On this basis, a new association rule based on this type of information granules is presented. Unlike most fuzzy association rules, the proposed association rules can extract and derive the correlations between two collections of trend features corresponding to the past and future, which is in accord with humans reasoning. Keeping in mind that the prediction process should center on essential rules while freeing from the interference of irrelevant rules, which contributes to a reliable prediction result; thus, a rule selection algorithm is involved so as one makes sure the accuracy and interpretability of the forecasting results. The design of short-term forecasting model based on fuzzy inference system is implemented, where the concept of granulation eliminates the commonly used alternative, i.e., the recursive iterations of one-step prediction. Experimental results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed model.

The forecasting results can assist the decision-making process, providing useful projections to specialists. In this paper, a hybrid approach named Parallel Recursive Singular Spectrum Analysis and Evolving Neuro-Fuzzy Network (PRSSA+ENFN) for forecasting univariate and multivariate experimental time series, with learning from data streams composed of time series samples, is presented. The adopted methodology considers an evolving neuro-fuzzy basis, i.e., the PRSSA+ENFN adapts, extends, and evolves the fuzzy rule structure from new incoming data of the time series. The time series is subdivided into unobservable components, which are patterns contained in the data, and the neuro-fuzzy network forecasts these component samples so to reconstruct the original time series considering future values. An alternative to determine the specific parameters of PRSSA+ENFN is the application of a genetic algorithm. Four multi-steps ahead forecasting experiments are outlined with univariate and multivariate time series. Finally, some competitive results in relation to other methods in literature are discussed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Evolving neuro-fuzzy; Genetic algorithm; Singular spectrum analysis; Time series forecasting; Unobservable components","Decision making; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Genetic algorithms; Spectrum analysis; Time series analysis; Evolving neuro-fuzzy; Fuzzy forecasting; Neuro-Fuzzy; Neuro-fuzzy network; Research topics; Singular spectrum analysis; Time series forecasting; Times series; Unobservable; Unobservable component; Time series",,,,,"Oliveira, J., Ludermir, T., A hybrid evolutionary decomposition system for time series forecasting (2016) Neurocomputing, 180, pp. 27-34; Du, S., Li, T., Yang, Y., Horng, S., Multivariate time series forecasting via attention-based encoder-decoder framework (2020) Neurocomputing, 388, pp. 269-279; de Oliveira, J., Pacífico, L., Neto, P., Barreiros, E., Rodrigues, C., Filho, A., A hybrid optimized error correction system for time series forecasting (2020) Appl.

In this work, we propose an automatic feature engineering framework for modeling the trend-cycle (tofee-tree) in time series forecasting. The first stage of the framework automatically creates over 286 deterministic linear and nonlinear engineered features to model the trend-cycle. These features are based only on the time of observation and length of the time series, making them domain-agnostic. In the second stage of the framework, a SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)—based feature selection procedure using Light Gradient Boosted Machine (LightGBM) selects the most relevant features. These relevant features can be used for forecasting with ANNs in addition to the auto-regressive lags. Two popular ANNs—Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Long Short Term Memory network (LSTM) are used to evaluate our proposed tofee-tree framework. Comparisons against two empirical studies using the M3 competition dataset show that the proposed framework improved the overall Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE) in the one-step, medium- and long-term. The relative improvement in one-step SMAPE is 3% for MLP and 23% for LSTM. We also show that the residual seasonality left after deseasonalization can be modeled using the tofee-tree framework. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Feature engineering; Long short term memory network; Multi-layer perceptron; Time series forecasting","Forecasting; Forestry; Multilayer neural networks; Time series; Time series analysis; Empirical studies; Feature engineerings; Mean absolute percentage error; Multi layer perceptron; Pre-processing step; Relevant features; Selection procedures; Time series forecasting; Long short-term memory",,,,,"Ahmed, N.K., Atiya, A.F., Gayar, N.E., El-Shishiny, H., An empirical comparison of machine learning models for time series forecasting (2010) Economet Rev, 29 (5-6), pp. 594-621; Ali, A., Zhu, Y., Chen, Q., Yu, J., Cai, H., (2019, December).

However, undesirable missing values are often encountered, which may adversely affect many forecasting tasks. In this study, we evaluate and compare the effects of imputation methods for estimating missing values in a time series. Our approach does not include a simulation to generate pseudo-missing data, but instead perform imputation on actual missing data and measure the performance of the forecasting model created therefrom. In an experiment, therefore, several time series forecasting models are trained using different training datasets prepared using each imputation method. Subsequently, the performance of the imputation methods is evaluated by comparing the accuracy of the forecasting models. The results obtained from a total of four experimental cases show that the k-nearest neighbor technique is the most effective in reconstructing missing data and contributes positively to time series forecasting compared with other imputation methods. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

Among them, different flavors of echo state networks have attracted many stares through time, mainly due to the simplicity and computational efficiency of their learning algorithm. However, these advantages do not compensate for the fact that echo state networks remain as black-box models whose decisions cannot be easily explained to the general audience. This issue is even more involved for multi-layered (also referred to as deep) echo state networks, whose more complex hierarchical structure hinders even further the explainability of their internals to users without expertise in machine learning or even computer science. This lack of explainability can jeopardize the widespread adoption of these models in certain domains where accountability and understandability of machine learning models is a must (e.g., medical diagnosis, social politics). This work addresses this issue by conducting an explainability study of echo state networks when applied to learning tasks with time series, image and video data. Among these tasks, we stress on the latter one (video classification) which, to the best of our knowledge, has never been tackled before with echo state networks in the related literature. Specifically, the study proposes three different techniques capable of eliciting understandable information about the knowledge grasped by these recurrent models, namely potential memory, temporal patterns and pixel absence effect. Potential memory addresses questions related to the effect of the reservoir size in the capability of the model to store temporal information, whereas temporal patterns unveil the recurrent relationships captured by the model over time. Finally, pixel absence effect attempts at evaluating the effect of the absence of a given pixel when the echo state network model is used for image and video classification. The benefits of the proposed suite of techniques are showcased over three different domains of applicability: time series modeling, image and, for the first time in the related literature, video classification. The obtained results reveal that the proposed techniques not only allow for an informed understanding of the way these models work, but also serve as diagnostic tools capable of detecting issues inherited from data (e.g., presence of hidden bias). © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Echo state networks; Explainable artificial intelligence; Randomization-based machine learning; Reservoir computing","Classification (of information); Computational efficiency; Deep neural networks; Diagnosis; Image classification; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Pixels; Time series; Time series analysis; Hierarchical structures; Machine learning models; Reservoir Computing; Temporal information; Three different techniques; Time series forecasting; Time series modeling; Video classification; Recurrent neural networks",,,,,"Jaeger, H., Adaptive nonlinear system identification with echo state networks (2003) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 609-616; Lukoševičius, M., Jaeger, H., Reservoir computing approaches to recurrent neural network training (2009) Computer Science Review, 3 (3), pp. 127-149; Gallicchio, C., Scardapane, S., (2020) Deep Randomized Neural Networks.

On the other hand, in a clinical scenario, human blood-clotting disease (Royal disease) detection has been considered an urgent issue that has to be solved. This study uses AIoT with deep long short-term memory networks for biosensing application and analyzes the potent clinical target, human blood clotting factor IX, by its aptamer/antibody as the probe on the microscaled fingers and gaps of the interdigitated electrode. The earlier results by the current–volt measurements have shown the changes in the surface modification. The limit of detection (LOD) was noticed as 1 pM with the antibody as the probe, whereas the aptamer behaved better with the LOD at 100 fM. The time-series predictions from the AIoT application supported the obtained results with the laboratory analyses using both probes. This application clearly supports the results obtained from the interdigitated electrode sensor as aptamer to be the better option for analyzing the blood clotting defects. The current study supports a great implementation of AIoT in sensing application and can be followed for other clinical biomarkers. © 2021 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.","aptamer;

It is not a trivial task, as there are various short-term and/or long-term temporal dependencies. Multiscale modeling has been considered as a promising strategy to solve this problem. However, the existing multiscale models either apply an implicit way to model the temporal dependencies or ignore the interrelationships between multiscale subseries. In this article, we propose a multiscale interactive recurrent network (MiRNN) to jointly capture multiscale patterns. MiRNN employs a deep wavelet decomposition network to decompose the raw time series into multiscale subseries. MiRNN introduces three key strategies (truncation, initialization, and message passing) to model the inherent interrelationships between multiscale subseries, as well as a dual-stage attention mechanism to capture multiscale temporal dependencies. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our model achieves promising performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

The transport literature is also sparse when it comes to city-scale traffic predictions, mainly because of low data availability. In this work, we report an effort to investigate whether deep learning models can be useful for the long-term large-scale traffic prediction task, while focusing on the scalability of the models. We investigate a city-scale traffic dataset with 14 weeks of speed observations collected every 15 minutes over 1098 segments in the hypercenter of Los Angeles, California. We look at a variety of state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning predictors for link-based predictions, and investigate how such predictors can scale up to larger areas with clustering, and graph convolutional approaches. We discuss that modelling temporal and spatial features into deep learning predictors can be helpful for long-term predictions, while simpler, not deep learning-based predictors, achieve very satisfactory performance for link-based and short-term forecasting. The trade-off is discussed not only in terms of prediction accuracy vs prediction horizon but also in terms of training time and model sizing.

Still, as spatiotemporal sequences that arise in the real world are noisy and chaotic, modeling approaches that utilize probabilistic temporal models, such as deep Markov models (DMMs), are favorable because of their ability to model uncertainty, increasing their robustness to noise. However, approaches based on DMMs do not maintain the spatial characteristics of spatiotemporal sequences, with most of the approaches converting the observed input into 1D data halfway through the model. To solve this, we propose a model that retains the spatial aspect of the target sequence with a DMM that consists of 2D convolutional neural networks. We then show the robustness of our method to data with large variance compared with naive forecast, vanilla DMM, and convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) using synthetic data, even outperforming the DNN models over a longer forecast period. We also point out the limitations of our model when forecasting real-world precipitation data and the possible future work that can be done to address these limitations, along with additional future research potential. © 2020 by the authors.

Sampling data are taken from the web page of the Wiener Börse and filtered on weekly basis to comply with weekly seasonality in eight years range. The aim is to construct several AAN models that meet certain criteria and evaluate them on the holdout subsample. Furthermore, the goal is to find the best model that can predict new upcoming yet unseen data with high accuracy. A data frame for testing forecasting performance is one month, a quartile, a half year, and one year period for which last year of the data sample is retained (August, 2016-August 2017). Using various criteria and different parameters, the total of thirty networks were built and tested and top five networks were analysed in more details. Results confirm high accuracy of using method of artificial neural networks, which is consistent to studies conducted on similar cases. Correlation of top three selected networks by validation subsample is over 0,9. The mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) for the best selected network are 1,76% (month); 2,11% (quartile); 2,21% (half-year); 2,13% (year). Once again, ANN method has proven to be a powerful forecasting tool. © 2020, Strojarski Facultet.

The forecasting of direct share time series on the O&D level, as part of the detailed demand forecasting, plays a fundamental role in air transportation planning and development. An accurate forecasting of the O&D direct share time series can benefit the air transportation planners, airlines, and airports in multiple ways. Based on the previous analysis, the direct share time series is O&D specific. This research focuses on developing accurate direct share time series forecasting models on O&D markets with different characteristics. Both classical time series models and supervised learning regression models are investigated carefully. A novel hybrid model that combines time series concept and machine learning modeling techniques is proposed, which can provide more accurate forecasting performance and valuable insights into the O&D markets. To automatically select the forecasting model for each O&D pair, a general modeling framework is proposed for direct share time series forecasting. Based on the forecasting performance comparison, the modeling framework can provide promising direct share time series forecasting, which is a reliable replacement for the model used in the Federal Aviation Administration Terminal Area Forecast. © 2020 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.",,"Commerce; Forecasting; Learning systems; Regression analysis; Time series; Time series analysis; Federal Aviation Administration; Forecasting performance; Machine learning models; Origin and destinations; Time series forecasting; Time series forecasting models; Transportation planners; Transportation planning; Air transportation",,,,,"(2017) Terminal Area Forecast Summary, Fiscal Year 2017-2045, , Office of Aviation Policy and Plans, Federal Aviation Administration, Washing-ton, D.C; Lijesen, M.

This paper proposes a new hybrid model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) technique and Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), a time series forecasting technique to capture the live stock market data of S&P 500 using preexisting Application Programming Interface (API). Rise and fall in stock values in the previous years is analyzed. A novel LSTM-ARIMA hybrid is designed for capturing the linear and non-linear portions of the time series. The Prophet forecasting library by Facebook has also been used that requires less preprocessing. Finally, both the approaches are compared and the one with better performance is accepted for the final stock market prediction system. In this case, Prophet has a high Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 27.59 and Mean Square Error (MSE) of 761.33 whereas the ARIMA-LSTM hybrid gives an MSE of 3.03 and RMSE of 1.74 along with a 99% fit of the model. Hence the hybrid performs much better than Prophet and is accepted as the final algorithm for implementation. © 2020 School of Science.","ARIMA; Auto regressive integrated moving average; Live data; Long short term memory; LSTM; Prophet; S and P 500; Stock market prediction; Time series forecasting; Yfinance","Application programming interfaces (API); Autoregressive moving average model; Commerce; Computer systems programming; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Mean square error; Time series; Time series analysis; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Hybrid model; Non linear; Previous year; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Root mean square errors; Stock market prediction; Time series forecasting; Long short-term memory",,,,,"Shah, D., Isah, H., Zulkernine, F.H., Stock Market Analysis: A Review and Taxonomy of Prediction Techniques (2019) International Journal of Financial Studies, 7 (26); Wen, M., Li, P., Zhang, L., Chen, Y., Stock Market Trend Prediction Using High-Order Information of Time Series (2019) IEEE Access, 7, pp. 28299-28308; Creighton, J., Zulkernine, F.H., Towards Building a Hybrid Model for Predicting Stock Indexes (2017) IEEE International Conference on Big Data; Maini, S.S., Govinda, K., Stock Market Prediction using Data Mining Techniques (2017) Proc.

An approach is proposed to solve this problem; the approach implies topic analysis of the user’s past trends (behavior) in operation with text content of various (including confidential) categories and forecast of their future behavior. The topic analysis of user’s operation implies determining the principal topics of their text content and calculating their respective weights at the given instants. Deviations in the behavior in the user’s operation with the content from the forecast are used to identify this user. In the framework of this approach, our own original time series forecasting method is proposed based on orthogonal non-negative matrix factorization (ONMF). Note that ONMF has not been used to solve time series forecasting problems before. The experimental research held on the example of real-world corporate emailing formed out of the Enron data set showed the proposed user identification approach to be applicable. © 2018, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","computer security; orthogonal non-negative matrix factorization; time series forecasting; topic modelling; user identification","Abstracting; Behavioral research; Factorization; Forecasting; Matrix algebra; Security of data; Time series; Experimental research; Nonnegative matrix factorization; Text content; Text information; Time series forecasting; Topic analysis; Topic modelling; User identification; Time series analysis",,,,,"Yampolskiy, V.R., Govindaraju, V., Behavioural biometrics: A survey and classification (2008) Int.

Daily runoff forecast is a hot topic in hydrologic analysis and water transport planning. The fractional differenceautoregressive model based on wavelet analysis (WFIAR) is used to forecast the daily runoff. The daily runoff time series from 2002 to 2013 of Hankou Hydrologic Station are decomposed by the orthogonal db4 wavelet function into a series of stationary high-frequency sub-sequences and a non-stationary low frequency subsequence. According to the Hurst exponent of the low frequency subsequence, the appropriate difference order is determined and fractional difference is made. The differenced low-frequency part and high-frequency parts set up autoregressive models separately. These models are combined to forecast the daily runoff time series in 2014 and 2015 separately. The first-order difference autoregression (DIAR) model and the first-order autoregression (WDIAR) model based on wavelet analysis are also established to compare the forecasting accuracy of different models. The results show that the prediction accuracy of WFIAR is higher than the other two models that reveal the advantage of WDIAR model in daily runoff forecast. © 2018 The Author(s).","Auto-regressive modelling mothed; Daily runoff time series; Fractional order difference; Wavelet analysis","Forecasting; Orthogonal functions; Regression analysis; Runoff; Time series; Wavelet analysis; Auto regressive models; Auto-regressive; First order differences; Forecasting accuracy; Fractional order; Hydrological time-series; Time series forecasting; Water transportation; Time series analysis",,,,,"Dariane, A.B., Azimi, S., Forecasting streamflow by combination of a genetic input selection algorithm and wavelet transforms using ANFIS models (2016) International Association of Scientific Hydrology Bulletin, 61, pp. 585-600; Combined stochastic models based on wavelet transform and its application to stochastic modelling of runoff time series (2002) Hydroeletric Energy, 1, pp. 15-17; Hu, S.M., Xu, W.S., Wang, Z.J., Network traffic modeling and prediction based on fractional difference and Fuzzy-AR (2006) Computer Engineering & Applications, 42 (19), pp. 104-107; Jayawardena, A.W., Xu, P.C., Li, W.K., Rainfall data simulation by the hidden markov model and discrete wavelet transformation (2009) Stochastic Environmental Research & Risk Assessment, 23, pp. 863-877; Kumar, P., Foufoula-Georgiou, E., A multicomponent decomposition of spatial rainfall fields: 1.

Preparedness planning relies on a number of inputs, including requirement analysis, to identify critical capability gaps. Modern data analysis can play an important role in identifying such future requirements. To this end, this paper presents an analytical study, consisting of both descriptive as well as predictive analysis, of historical defence operational data. The descriptive analysis component of the methodology focuses on identifying useful features in the collected data for building a predictive model. The predictive analysis investigates existing patterns in the data, including spatial and temporal trends. An artificial neural network based time series forecasting model is developed to predict future operations based on the identified features. The proposed methodology is applied to a defence operational data set, built from a number of unclassified sources relating to the historical operational deployments of the Australian Defence Force between 1885 and 2012. Implications are also discussed. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","artificial neural networks; correspondence analysis; Defence preparedness analysis; temporal trend analysis; time series analysis","Data handling; Information analysis; Neural networks; Predictive analytics; Australian defence forces; Correspondence analysis; Defence preparedness analysis; Descriptive analysis; Operational deployments; Spatial and temporal trends; Temporal trends; Time series forecasting models; Time series analysis",,,,,"Paton, D., Smith, L., Johnston, D., When good intentions turn bad: Promoting natural hazard preparedness (2005) Aust J Emergen Manage, 20, p. 25; Perry, R.W., Lindell, R.K., Preparedness for emergency response: guidelines for the emergency planning process (2003) Disasters, 27, pp. 336-350; Burns, W.J., Slovic, P., The diffusion of fear: Modeling community response to a terrorist strike (2007) J Def Model Simulat: Appl, Methodol, Technol, 4, pp. 298-317; Holt, V.K., Berkman, T.C., (2006) The impossible mandate?: military preparedness, the responsibility to protect and modern peace operations, , Washington DC, Henry L.

In fuzzy time series analysis, the intervals’ length and the number of intervals are important issues. This paper proposes a new method for partitioning the universe of discourse to improve forecasting in fuzzy time series. The method can generate unequal length intervals for interval partitioning problem by affinity propagation clustering. Meanwhile, the intervals determined by typical cluster members make the fuzzy intervals more meaningful. For evaluating the performance of the proposed approach, an experimental study is reported using the well-known enrollment data of the University of Alabama. The comparison is carried out with regard to other fuzzy time series forecasting methods.
