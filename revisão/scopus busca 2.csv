However, the existing deep learning models still have shortcomings in dealing with periodic and long-distance dependent sequences, which lead to unsatisfactory forecasting performance on this type of dataset. To handle these two issues better, this paper proposes a novel periodic time series forecasting model based on DA-RNN, called DA-SKIP. Using the idea of task decomposition, the novel model, based on DA-RNN, GRU-SKIP and autoregressive component, breaks down the prediction of periodic time series into three parts: linear forecasting, nonlinear forecasting and periodic forecasting. The results of the experiments on Solar Energy, Electricity Consumption and Air Quality datasets show that the proposed model outperforms the three comparison models in capturing periodicity and long-distance dependence features of sequences. © 2021 by the authors.

Type-1 fuzzy functions (T1FFs) were used to forecast functions using an autoregressive model. However, rather than relying solely on past values of the forecast variable in a regression, the inclusion of past forecast errors improves forecasting ability. In this sense, the moving average model also employed in the proposed method. The inputs therefore are a combination of the past values of the time series and the past errors. The main idea of T1FFs is to include a new variable (or variables) that provides more information about the time series. The fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM) algorithm was used to quantify the values of this new variable. The degrees of memberships were obtained for each observation in each cluster and these membership grades were used as a new variable in the input matrix. Studies in the literature, however, have shown certain restrictions for FCM, such as sensitive noise and coincidence cluster centers. Consequently, possibilistic FCM is employed in T1FFs to overcome the aforementioned limitations. Because of the non-derivative objective function of ARMA type possibilistic fuzzy forecasting functions, the GWO was adapted in order to obtain coefficients for the model. The performance of the proposed ARMA type-1 fuzzy possibilistic functions was validated using 16 practical time-series. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","ARMA model;

Previous authors have extended nonlinear time-series forecasting to continuous spatial data. Here, we adjust spatial forecasting to handle discrete data and apply the technique to explore the ubiquity of nonlinear determinism in irregular spatial configurations of coral and algal taxa from Palmyra Atoll, a relatively pristine reef in the central Pacific Ocean. We find that the spatial distributions of coral and algal taxa show signs of nonlinear determinism in some locations and that these signals can change through time. We introduce the hypothesis that nonlinear spatial determinism may be a signal of systems in intermediate developmental (i.e. successional) stages, with spatial randomness characterizing early (i.e. recruitment dominated) and late-successional (i.e. 'climax' or attractor) phases. Common state-based metrics that sum community response to environmental forcing lack resolution to detect dynamics of (potential) recovery phases; incorporating signal of spatial patterning among sessile taxa holds unique promise to elucidate dynamical characters of complex ecological systems, thereby enhancing study and response efforts. © 2019 The Authors.

The proposed method is called autoregressive adaptive network fuzzy inference system (AR–ANFIS). AR–ANFIS can be shown in a network structure. The architecture of the network has two parts. The first part is an ANFIS structure and the second part is a linear AR model structure. In the literature, AR models and ANFIS are widely used in time series forecasting. Linear AR models are used according to model-based strategy. A nonlinear model is employed by using ANFIS. Moreover, ANFIS is a kind of data-based modeling system like artificial neural network. In this study, a linear and nonlinear forecasting model is proposed by creating a hybrid method of AR and ANFIS. The new method has advantages of data-based and model-based approaches. AR–ANFIS is trained by using particle swarm optimization, and fuzzification is done by using fuzzy C-Means method. AR–ANFIS method is examined on some real-life time series data, and it is compared with the other time series forecasting methods. As a consequence of applications, it is shown that the proposed method can produce accurate forecasts. © 2016, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.","Adaptive network fuzzy inference system; Autoregressive model; Fuzzy C-Means; Fuzzy inference system; Particle swarm optimization; Time series","Forecasting; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy systems; Network architecture; Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Time series; Adaptive network fuzzy inference systems; Auto regressive models; Fuzzy C mean; Fuzzy C means method; Fuzzy inference systems; Model-based strategy; Nonlinear forecasting; Time series forecasting; Fuzzy inference",,,,,"Baş, E., Eğrioğlu, E., Fuzzy-time-series network used to forecast linear and nonlinear time series (2015) Appl Intell, 43, pp. 343-355; Bezdek, J., Ehrlich, R., FCM: the Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm (1984) Comput Geosci, 10 (2-3), pp. 191-203; Catalao, J., Pousinho, H., Hybrid wavelet-PSO–ANFIS approach for short-term wind power forecasting in Portugal (2011) IEEE Trans Sustain Energy, 2 (1), pp. 50-59; Catalao, J., Pousinho, H., Hybrid wavelet–PSO–ANFIS approach for short-term electricity prices forecasting (2011) Power Syst, 26 (1), pp. 137-144; Catalao, J., Osorio, G., (2011) Application of an intelligent system based on EPSO and ANFIS to price forecasting, , In, IEEE ISAP; Chabaa, S., Zeroual, A., ANFIS method for forecasting internet traffic time series (2009) 2009 mediterrannean microwave symposium (MMS).
